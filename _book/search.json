Such amount of recirculated water is hard to estimate and, in the lack of a better model, we simply assume this to be negligible, except when a positive amount is required by Equation 4.4 itself, due the physical constraint that \\(I_t \\geq 0\\).\nOnce \\(O_t\\) is calculated through Equation 4.5, \\(I_t\\) can be immediately obtained from Equation 4.4. Notice that whenever the aforementioned compensating outflow term due to water recirculation is included (which happens when the maximum in Eq. 4.5 is given by the second term), the total inflow is always estimated to be zero.\n\n\n4.4.2 Rice field clusters\nWater balance calculations for rice field clusters are complex due to the lack of observational data. The simulation algorithm relies on several key components:\n\nThe hydrology of the Albufera lake (Section 4.4.1).\nAssumptions about the hydrological connections between the various water bodies in the natural park, detailed in Section 4.3.\nAn ideal yearly management plan for irrigation and drainage of the rice paddies.\n\nThe quantitative inputs for this calculation are collected in the following table; see the definition of the management_df input data frame, discussed in Section 3.3.3.

On the other hand, clusters are assumed to be irrigated from sources external the Albufera system, i.e., not through any of the ditches that eventually flow into the lake. According to our assumptions on the hydrology of clusters and ditches (cf. Section 4.3), the sum of cluster outflows is constrained by:\n\\[ \\sum _{c = 1} ^ {N_C} O_{c,t} \\leq Q_t  \\tag{4.7}\\]\nwhere \\(Q_t\\) denotes the inflow to the relevant ditch. With a small leap in logic, we anticipate from Section 4.4.3, that the water levels in irrigation ditches are assumed to be constant, so that \\(Q_t\\) can also be identified with the ditch outflow, that is in turn estimated as:\n\\[ Q_t = \\frac{\\text{Area of clusters draining into ditch}}{\\text{Area of all clusters}} \\times \\text{Lake's Inflow}_t  \\tag{4.8}\\]\nwhere the lake’s inflow is computed as described in Section 4.4.1.\nQualitatively speaking, the simulation determines daily values of \\(I_{c,t}\\) and \\(O_{c,t}\\) that satisfy Eqs. 4.6 and 4.7, and such that the resulting hydrology aligns as closely as possible with the “ideal” conditions prescribed by the specified management plan. This is accomplished in three steps:\n\nComputing ideal inflows and outflows based on current water levels and management plans.\nDetermining actual inflows and outflows, along with the corresponding actual water level changes.\n\nAdjusting management plan delays if some clusters were scheduled to be drained but could not be due to insufficient flow through the common ditch (see below for details).\n\nThese steps are iterated on a daily basis, starting from some initial time (say \\(t = 0\\)) at which all cluster water levels match the ideal ones, and no plan delays are present.\nConcerning the last step, a few words may serve to clarify the algorithm described below. The purpose of management plan delays is to ensure that during each year’s sowing season, all cluster’s are eventually emptied as required for ground applications of chemicals (modeled in subsequent layers of the simulation). This is achieved by postponing the management plan by one day whenever an emptying condition is not met. Outside of the sowing window, delays are reset to zero to prevent them from accumulating indefinitely, which would be unrealistic.\nIn what follows, the conversion between cluster water volumes and depths is provided by \\(V_{c,t} = A_c \\cdot h_{c,t}\\), and we denote by \\(\\delta_{c,t}\\) the time series of plan delays for cluster \\(c\\), which is initialized by \\(\\delta_{c,0} =0\\).\n\n4.4.2.1 Step 1: ideal balance\nIdeal balance quantities for each cluster \\(c\\) are obtained from the management plan data-set, whose relevant row is identified by the cluster’s rice variety \\(v\\) and field type \\(\\theta\\), and the delayed day:\n\\[\nd_{c,t+1} = d_{t+1}-\\delta_{c,t},\n\\tag{4.9}\\]\nwhere \\(d_{t+1}\\) denotes the day of year corresponding to time \\(t+1\\), and \\(\\delta_{c,t}\\) the accumulated plan delay.\nLet \\(h _{c,t+1}^{\\text{id}}\\) denote the ideal depth for cluster \\(c\\) at time \\(t+1\\) retrieved in this way, and \\(\\text{Ir}_{c,t}\\), \\(\\text{Dr}_{c,t}\\) the corresponding irrigation and draining plans. Furthermore, denote by \\(V_{c,t+1}^{\\text{id}} = A_c \\cdot h_{c,t+1}^{\\text{id}}\\) the corresponding ideal water volume.\nIn order to compute ideal inflow and outflow, we require (cf. Equation 4.6):\n\\[\nV_{c,t+1}^{\\text{id}} = \\max \\lbrace V_{c,t}^{\\text{id}}  + (\\text{P}_t-\\text{ETP}_t)\\times A_c,0 \\rbrace + I_{c,t}^{\\text{id}}-O_{c,t}^{\\text{id}}\n\\tag{4.10}\\]\nClearly, Equation 4.10 alone does not individually specify \\(I_{c,t}^{\\text{id}}\\) and \\(O_{c,t}^{\\text{id}}\\), but only their difference \\(\\Delta _{c,t}^{\\text{id}}= I_{c,t}^{\\text{id}}-O_{c,t}^{\\text{id}}\\). In order to fix both these quantities:\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\n(I_{c,t} ^\\text{id})^{(0)}&= \\begin{cases}\n  k_\\text{flow}  & \\text{if }\\text{Ir}_{c,t} = \\text{Dr}_{c,t} = 1 \\\\\n  0 & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases},\\\\\n(O_{c,t} ^\\text{id})^{(0)}&=(I_{c,t} ^\\text{id})^{(0)}-\\Delta _{c,t}^{\\text{id}}.\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{4.11}\\]\nand, in order to ensure that flows are positive, we finally set:\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\nO_{c,t} ^\\text{id} &= \\max\\lbrace(O_{c,t} ^\\text{id})^{(0)},\\,0\\rbrace\\\\\nI_{c,t} ^\\text{id} &= O_{c,t} ^\\text{id} + \\Delta _{c,t}^{\\text{id}},\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{4.12}\\]\nwhich satisfy Equation 4.10 and give rise to positive \\(O_{c,t}^\\text{id}\\) and \\(I_{c,t}^\\text{id}\\).\n\n\n4.4.2.2 Step 2: real balance\nAt each time-step \\(t\\), the cluster’s index set is randomly permuted 2, and the real flows are calculated as:\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\nO_{c,t} &= \\min \\lbrace O_{c,t}^\\text{id},\\,Q_t-\\sum_{c'&lt;c}O_{c',t} \\rbrace ,\\\\\nI_{c,t} &= \\max\\lbrace I_{c,t}^\\text{id}-O_{c,t}^\\text{id} + O_{c,t},\\,0 \\rbrace\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{4.13}\\]\nIn simple terms, clusters are emptied in a random order within the allowed capacity of the corresponding ditch. Using Equation 4.13, we finally determine the real water level achieved as:\n\\[\nV_{c,t+1} = \\max \\lbrace V_{c,t}  + (\\text{P}_t-\\text{ETP}_t)\\times A_c,0 \\rbrace + I_{c,t}-O_{c,t}\n\\tag{4.14}\\]\nto be compared with Equation 4.10.\n\n\n4.4.2.3 Step 3: updating the plan delay\nThe updated value \\(\\delta _{c,t+1}\\) is obtained as follows. If \\(d_{t+1}\\) (the actual day of year) is outside of the window \\(W = [\\text{20th of April},\\,\\text{15th of October}]\\), then \\(\\delta_{c,t+1} = 0\\). Otherwise, if \\(h_{c,t}^\\text{id} &gt; 0\\) or \\(h_{c,t} &lt; h_{\\text{thres}}\\), the plan delay is unchanged: \\(\\delta_{c,t+1} = \\delta_{c,t}\\). Finally, if \\(h_{c,t}^\\text{id} = 0\\) but \\(h_{c,t} &gt; h_{\\text{thres}}\\), we add one day of delay: \\(\\delta_{c,t+1} = \\delta_{c,t}+1\\).\n\n\n4.4.2.4 Step 3: updating the plan delay\nThe updated value \\(\\delta _{c,t+1}\\) is obtained as follows. If \\(d_{t+1}\\) (the actual day of year) is outside of the window \\(W = [\\text{20th of April},\\,\\text{15th of October}]\\), then \\(\\delta_{c,t+1} = 0\\). Otherwise, if \\(h_{c,t}^\\text{id} &gt; 0\\) or \\(h_{c,t} &lt; h_{\\text{thres}}\\), the plan delay is unchanged: \\(\\delta_{c,t+1} = \\delta_{c,t}\\). Finally, if \\(h_{c,t}^\\text{id} = 0\\) but \\(h_{c,t} &gt; h_{\\text{thres}}\\), we add one day of delay: \\(\\delta_{c,t+1} = \\delta_{c,t}+1\\).\n\n\n\n4.4.3 Irrigation ditches\nOur approach to the hydrology of irrigation ditches is simplified, with the main assumption being that all ditches have a common, constant water depth \\(h_\\text{ditch}\\) corresponding to the input parameter ditch_level_m.\nUsing the index \\(D =1,2,\\dots,26\\) to enumerate the park’s main ditches, ditch outflows to the Albufera lake \\(O_{D,t}\\) are calculated according to Equation 4.8. These outflows also coincide with the total ditch inflows \\(I_{D,t}\\) (due to the constant water volume assumption).",

For each scheduled application, this data set specifies:\nTo determine the actual application date, we proceed as follows (for notation related to cluster hydrology, see Section 4.4.2):\nThese steps are repeated for all subsequent applications of a given pesticide in a given cluster.

    "text": "5.2 Pesticide dispersion\nAs illustrated in our hydrological model (Figure 4.1), pesticides applied to rice field clusters are transported through water flow into ditches, then into the Albufera lake, and ultimately to the sea.\nFrom a mathematical perspective, the fate of these chemicals is governed by a system of differential equations that captures key physico-chemical processes, including transport, diffusion between compartments, and degradation.\nThe remainder of this chapter describes our approach to pesticide dispersion. We define the simplified differential system used to model these processes in Section 5.2.2, and we present our semi-analytic solution method in Section 5.2.3.\n\n5.2.1 Diagram of physical processes\nThe schematic diagram below illustrates the processes captured by our model for chemical dispersion. Directional arrows represent the transfer of chemical matter among the three compartments considered—Foliage, Water, and Soil—as well as exchanges with external water bodies (denoted as “Watercourse”).\nWhile the overall scheme applies to all landscape elements, specific details vary for clusters, ditches, and the lake (cf. the hydrological model of Figure 4.1):\n\nClusters: Inflow waters originate outside the system and are assumed to be free of pesticides.\nDitches and the Albufera lake: No direct pesticide applications occur in these areas, meaning the foliage compartment plays no role in their dynamics.\nDitches: Receive inflows from two sources—clusters, which contribute pesticide-laden water, and external sources, which are assumed to be free of chemicals.\nAlbufera lake: Its only inflows come from ditches, which contain nonzero chemical concentrations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.1: Scheme of physical processes considered in ERAHUMED model of chemical dispersion\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2.2 Evolution Equations\nAs in Section 5.1, we focus on a single pesticide and a fixed hydrological element (e.g., a cluster). We denote its masses in the three compartments—foliage, water, and sediment—by \\(m_f\\), \\(m_w\\), and \\(m_s\\), respectively. We assume that, at any given time, these masses are fully diluted and homogeneously distributed. In particular, we can meaningfully define spatially constant concentrations \\(c_f\\) and \\(c_s\\) in the water1 and sediment compartments.\nWe first describe the differential system that drives the temporal dynamics of \\(m_f\\), \\(m_w\\) and \\(m_s\\). The correspondence between the parameters used in this and the following Section is provided in Section 5.2.4.\nThe fundamental equations describing pesticide diffusion are given as follows:\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\dfrac{\\text d{m}_f}{\\text d t} & = -(k_f+w)m_f+a_f\\\\\n\\dfrac{\\text d{m}_w}{\\text d t} & = -(k_w+d_w+s+\\frac{O}{V})m_w+d_sm_s+wm_f+a_w-\\sigma(\\frac{m_w}{\\rho V}) \\\\\n\\dfrac{\\text d{m}_s}{\\text d t} & = (d_w+s)m_w-(k_s+d_s)m_s+a_s+\\sigma(\\frac{m_w}{\\rho V})\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{5.1}\\]\nwhere:\n\n\\(a_{f,w,s}\\) are the mass income rates of the chemical in the three compartments, that include direct pesticide application and mass coming from inflows.\n\\(k_{f,w,s}\\) are the degradation rates of the chemical in the three compartments,\n\\(d_w\\) and \\(d_s\\) are the water-sediment diffusion rates,\n\\(s\\) is the settling rate,\n\\(w\\) is the washout rate,\n\\(O\\) is the outflow rate of the rice field,\n\\(V\\) is the volume of water in the rice field,\n\\(\\rho\\) is the chemical solubility in water,\n\\(\\sigma(x)\\) is a function (not further specified, see below) that grows quickly for \\(x &gt; 1\\), and vanishes for \\(x \\leq 1\\). This function accounts for solubility.\n\nStrictly speaking, all these terms have instantaneous time dependence2. Apart from making the system 5.1 hard to attack by analytic means, such a dependence is troubling because we don’t have access to the exact time dependence of the majority of these terms (e.g. outflow, volume or chemical applications), our input consisting of simple daily average/cumulative values. On the other hand, if all the terms were constant, and if we could neglect \\(\\sigma\\), the solution of Equation 5.1 would be immediate, as the corresponding system becomes a linear ODE with constant coefficients, in addition whose eigenvalues and eigenvectors can be computed explicitly.\nWhat we use in practice is an intermediate semi-analytic approach that allows us to compute daily values of \\(m_{f,w,s}\\), which is described next.\n\n\n5.2.3 Semi-analytic solution of Equation 5.1\nThe time evolution of \\(m_{f,w,s}\\) in a daily time-step (from \\(t\\) to \\(t+1\\), say, assuming \\(t\\) is measured in days) is obtained through the following four consecutive stages:\n\nWe compute the exact evolution of \\(m_{f,w,s}\\) according to the linear ODE obtained by disregarding the processes of outflow, chemical application and solubility, and using daily constant values for all the remaining constants involved (described in more detail below).\nWe compute the \\(m_w\\) losses due to outflow as if they happened instantaneously after the processes computed in the previous step took place, with the water volume of the rice paddy varying from \\(V(t+1)+O(t)\\) to \\(V(t+1)\\).\nWe compute the mass applications again as instantaneous, after the losses in the water compartment due to outflows took place.\nWe compare the resulting \\(m_w\\) with the maximum amount allowed by the solubility in water, that is \\(m_w ^{\\text{max}}(t) = \\rho V(t+1)\\) and transfer any excess to the sediment compartment (\\(m_s\\)).\n\nIn the following, we describe in full detail the computations involved in these four steps.\n\n5.2.3.1 Step 1: linear ODE evolution (physico-chemical processes)\nDisregarding outflow, mass application and solubility, we get a linear ODE of the form:\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\dfrac{\\text d{m}_f}{\\text d t} & = \\gamma m_f,\\\\\n\\dfrac{\\text d{m}_w}{\\text d t} & = a_{ww} m_w+a_{ws}m_s + w m_f, \\\\\n\\dfrac{\\text d{m}_s}{\\text d t} & = a_{sw}m_w+a_{ss}m_s,\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{5.2}\\]\nwith:\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\gamma                  &= -(k_f + w),\\\\\na_{ww}                  &= - (k_w + d_ w +s)\\\\\na_{ws}                  &= d_s\\\\\na_{sw}                  &= d_w+s\\\\\na_{ss}                  &= -(k_s+d_s)\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{5.3}\\]\nwhere the various physico-chemical parameters are assumed to be constant during a daily time-step (cf. Section 5.2.4).\nThe evolution of \\(m_f\\) is easily obtained:\n\\[\nm_f(t) = e^{\\gamma t}m_f(0).\n\\tag{5.4}\\]\nPlugging this into the three-dimensional system 5.2 we obtain a reduced two-dimensional system for the water-sediment compartments:\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\dfrac{\\text d{m}_w}{\\text d t} & = a_{ww} m_w+a_{ws}m_s + w e ^{\\gamma t}m_f(0), \\\\\n\\dfrac{\\text d{m}_s}{\\text d t} & = a_{sw}m_w+a_{ss}m_s,\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{5.5}\\]\nwhich is solved explicitly with standard methods3.\n\n\n5.2.3.2 Step 2: mass losses due to outflow\nMass losses due to outflow are computed as if the outflow process happened instantaneously after the processes discussed in the previous step took place. The amount of mass in the water compartment is affected as follows:\n\\[\nm_w \\to \\frac{V_f}{V_i} m_w,\n\\tag{5.6}\\]\nwhere \\(V_i\\) and \\(V_f\\) denote the initial and final volume for the outflow process. Here \\(V_f\\) coincides with the simulated value \\(V(t+1)\\) for the relevant water body and \\(V_i = V_f + O(t)\\), where \\(O(t)\\) denotes the total simulated outflow for day \\(t\\).\n\n\n5.2.3.3 Step 3: mass income from direct application and inflows\nThese contributions are computed as instantaneous and subsequent to outflow. Masses in the various compartments (\\(i = f,\\,w,\\,s\\)) are modified as follows: \\[\nm_i \\to m_i + a_i\n\\tag{5.7}\\]\nAs mentioned above, \\(a_i\\) accounts for both direct pesticide applications and water inflow, that is:\n\\[\na_i = a_i ^{\\text{app}} + a_i ^{\\text{inflow}}\n\\] The calculation of direct application rates from input parameters is described below. As to the second term, the amount of incoming mass is exactly given by the amount of outgoing mass in the outflow of the preceding element along the water course chain, which is computed as detailed in the previous Section.\n\n\n5.2.3.4 Step 4: solubility\nThe chemical density in the water compartment after Steps 1, 2, and 3 is eventually compared with the chemical’s solubility \\(\\rho\\), and any mass excess is instantaneously transferred to the sediment compartment. This implies the following modifications:\n\\[\nm_s \\to m_s + \\max(0, \\,m_w - \\rho V(t+1)),\\quad m_w\\to\\max(m_w,\\,\\rho V(t+1)).\n\\tag{5.8}\\]\n\n\n\n5.2.4 Input parameters (correspondence with Chapter 3)\nThis Section describes the sources of the various numerical inputs to Equation 5.1.\n\n5.2.4.1 Pesticide application rates\nApplication rates are given by:\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\na_f^{\\text{app}} &= A(t)\\cdot (1-\\text{drift})\\cdot c(t),\\\\\na_s^{\\text{app}} &= A(t)\\cdot (1-\\text{drift})(1-c(t))I(h(t+1)\\neq0),\\\\\na_w^{\\text{app}} &= A(t)\\cdot (1-\\text{drift})\\cdot(1-\\text{SNK})(1-c(t))I(h(t+1)=0),\\\\\n\\end{split}\n\\] Here, \\(A(t)\\) is the applied amount on day \\(t\\), whose computation was described in this chapter; \\(I(h(t+1)=0)\\) is equal to one if the water level of the cluster \\(h(t+1) =0\\), and vanishes otherwise4; the quantities \\(\\text{drift}\\), \\(\\text{SNK}\\) correspond to the internal drift and SNK parameters (cf. Chapter 3); finally \\(c\\) is the coverage fraction, computed as:\n\\[\nc = \\min\\left[\\frac{d_s(t)}{j_{\\text{grow}}},\\,1\\right]\\cdot c_{\\text{max}},\n\\] where \\(d_s(t)\\) is the number of days elapsed from seeding, assumed to be on the 20th of April, while \\(j_\\text{grow}\\) and \\(c_\\text{max}\\) correspond to the input parameters jgrow and covmax.\n\n\n5.2.4.2 Degradation rates\nDaily degradation rates \\(k_{f,w,s}(t)\\) for the chemical are modeled through the Arrhenius equation, schematically:\n\\[\nk(t) = k_0 \\cdot Q_{10}^{\\frac{T(t)-T_0}{10}}\n\\] where \\(k_0\\) is the degradation rate \\(k_0\\) at a reference temperature \\(T_0\\), \\(Q_{10}\\) is a numerical constant, and \\(T(t)\\) is the average temperature on day \\(t\\). The constants \\(k_0\\) and \\(Q_10\\) are internal model parameters, while \\(T(t)\\) is given by weather_df$temperature_ave, see Section 3.3.1.\n\n\n5.2.4.3 Diffusion rates\nDiffusion rates are given by:\n\\[\nd_w(t) = \\frac{k_\\text{dif}\\cdot f_{D,w}}{h(t)}, \\quad d_s = \\frac{k_\\text{dif}\\cdot f_{D,s}}{h_{\\text{act}}\\cdot \\text{pos}}\n\\] where \\(h(t)\\) is the water depth of the hydrological element; \\(h_\\text{act}\\) is the depth of active sediment, corresponding to the input parameter dact_m; \\(text{pos}\\) is the porosity, and is expressed in terms of input parameters as fc - wilting; \\(k_\\text{dif}\\) is given by the empirical formula (see TODO):\n\\[\nk_\\text{dif} = \\left( \\frac{69.35}{365} - \\text{pos}\\cdot M^{-2/3} \\right)\\frac{\\text{m}}{\\text{day}}\n\\] where \\(M\\) is the molecular weight of the chemical (internal parameter); finally, \\(f_{D,w}\\) and \\(f_{D,s}\\) are given by:\n\n\n5.2.4.4 Settling rate\nThe daily settling rate is computed as:\n\\[\ns(t) = \\dfrac{k_s(1-f_{D,w})}{h(t)}\n\\] where \\(k_s\\) is a (chemical-specific) internal parameter.\n\n\n5.2.4.5 Washout rate\nThe daily washout rate is computed as:\n\\[\nw(t) = \\text{fet} \\cdot P(t)\n\\] where \\(P(t)\\) is the daily precipitation per unit area, while \\(\\text{fet}\\) is a (chemical-specific) internal parameter.\n\n\n5.2.4.6 Solubility\nThe solubility \\(\\rho\\) of chemical is an internal parameter.",
