    "text": "2.2 Local balance of rice paddy clusters\nAs anticipated, the simulation of local hydrological balance of rice paddies involves an important set of assumptions regarding the management of water levels. We detail in this section the algorithm used in our simulations.\n\n2.2.1 Model inputs and parameters\nThe two main observational inputs for this modeling layer are:\n\nThe output of the “Global balance” model, described in the previous Section, and in particular the daily total inflow to the Albufera lake, obtained from Equation 2.1. As explained below in Section 2.2.2, this is used to estimate the inflow from each of the twenty-six ditches that flow into the Albufera.\nThe measured amounts of precipitation and evapotranspiration, which is the same data-set involved in global balance calculations, and is described in Section A.2.\n\nThe subdivision of the rice fields surface of the Albufera into clusters of a specific rice variety, and the corresponding assignation of a single ditch to each cluster is described in Section A.5.\nOur assumptions on the management of water levels are subsumed in the data-set described in Section A.3, that provides the irrigation and draining plans and the ideal water levels for a cluster of a given rice variety, for each day of the year.\nFinally, the model receives a few other numerical input parameters:\n\nIdeal flow rate \\(k\\). Rate at which water flows through rice paddies when these are being simultaneously irrigated and drained, with the overall level being kept constant. Expressed in \\(\\text{cm}\\cdot\\text{day}^{-1}\\). [TODO: this must be some cumbersome paraphrase of a technical expression which I don’t know about.].\nHeight threshold \\(H_{\\text{thres}}\\). Maximum allowed water level for a cluster to be considered emptied, used in the calculation of draining/irrigation plan delays. Expressed in \\(\\text{cm}\\).\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Ditch inflows\nThe first step consists in breaking down the total inflow to the lake, obtained through Equation 2.1, into inflows from individual ditches. Each paddy cluster is assumed to communicate with a single ditch (cf. Section A.5), and the flow through a ditch is assumed to be proportional to the total area of clusters belonging to said ditch. Therefore, denoting by \\(I_i\\) and \\(A_i\\) the inflow and area of ditch \\(i\\), and by \\(I\\) the total inflow, we compute:\n\\[\nI_i = \\frac{A_i}{\\sum _j A_j} \\cdot I\n\\tag{2.7}\\]\n\n\n2.2.3 Main Algorithm\nIn the following, we focus on the set of clusters that communicate with a specific ditch, whose inflow (estimated according to Section 2.2.2) we denote by \\(Q\\). The essence of the algorithm is to approximate as closely as possible the cluster’s ideal inflows and outflows, with the constraint that the sum of the actual outflows from all clusters must equal \\(Q\\).\nLet us start by setting up some basic notation. We denote by:\n\\[\nh_c ^\\text{id}(t),\\quad I_c ^\\text{id}(t),\\quad O_c ^\\text{id}(t),\n\\tag{2.8}\\]\nthe ideal water level, inflow and outflow of cluster \\(c\\) at time (i.e. day) \\(t\\), and by:\n\\[\nh_c ^\\text{re}(t),\\quad I_c ^\\text{re}(t),\\quad O_c ^\\text{re}(t),\n\\tag{2.9}\\]\nthe corresponding real quantities. The area of cluster \\(c\\), that provides the conversion between water volumes and column heights, is denoted by \\(A_c\\). Precipitation and evapotranspiration water column values are denoted by:\n\\[\n\\text{P}(t),\\quad \\text{ETP}(t).\n\\tag{2.10}\\]\nFinally, we will define below a plan delay accumulated for cluster \\(c\\) at time \\(t\\), denoted \\(D_c(t)\\). This is computed recursively along the iterations of the algorithm, and its role will be clarified below.\nThe local balance algorithm proceeds iteratively as follows. At day \\(t\\), assume that \\(h_c ^\\text{re}(t-1)\\) and \\(D(t-1)\\) have already been computed; a single iteration consists of the following steps, which we describe in full detail below:\n\nStep 1. Recovering the \\(h_c ^\\text{id}(t)\\), \\(I_c ^\\text{id}(t)\\) and \\(O_c ^\\text{id}(t)\\) from the irrigation and draining plan, applying the computed plan delay \\(D_c(t-1)\\).\n\n\nStep 2. Computing \\(h_c ^\\text{re}(t)\\), \\(I_c ^\\text{re}(t)\\) and \\(O_c ^\\text{re}(t)\\) enforcing the constraint \\(\\sum _c O_c ^\\text{re}(t) = Q(t)\\).\nStep 3. Computing the updated plan delays \\(D_c(t)\\).\n\nIn order to initialize the iteration, we assume that at some initial time, say \\(t = 0\\), we have \\(D_c(t=0) = 0\\) \\(h_c ^\\text{re}(t=0) = h_c ^\\text{id}(t=1)\\).\n\n2.2.3.1 Step 1: ideal balance\nThe management data-set described Section A.3 provides the ideal water level for each cluster and for every day of the year. Denoting by \\(d(t)\\) the day of the year corresponding to \\(t\\), the relevant entry of the management data-set is that corresponding to day:\n\\[\nd^\\prime_c(t) = d(t) - D_c(t-1),\n\\tag{2.11}\\]\nwhere \\(D_c(t-1)\\) is the accumulated plan delay for thi cluster. Therefore we set:\n\\[\nh_c^\\text{id}(t) = \\text{Planned water level on day of year }d_c^\\prime(t).\n\\tag{2.12}\\]\nTo compute ideal inflow and outflow, we require:\n\\[\nh_c^\\text{id}(t) = \\max(0,\\,h_c^\\text{re}(t-1)+\\text{P}(t)-\\text{ETP}(t)) + I_c ^\\text{id}(t)-O_c ^\\text{id}(t),\n\\tag{2.13}\\]\nwhere we assume \\(I_c ^\\text{id}(t) &gt;0\\) and \\(O_c ^\\text{id}(t)&gt;0\\). Clearly, Equation 2.13 alone does not individually specify \\(I_c ^\\text{id}(t)\\) and \\(O_c ^\\text{id}(t)\\), but only their difference \\(\\Delta _c (t) = I_c ^\\text{id}(t) - O_c ^\\text{id}(t)\\). In order to fix both these quantities, we first define1:\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\n(I_c ^\\text{id}(t))^{(0)}&= \\begin{cases}\n  k  & \\text{cluster planned to be in flux on day of year } d_c^\\prime(t) \\\\\n  0 & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases},\\\\\n(O_c ^\\text{id}(t))^{(0)}&=(I_c ^\\text{id}(t))^{(0)}-\\Delta_c(t).\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{2.14}\\]\nand, in order to ensure that flows are positive2, we finally set:\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\nO_c ^\\text{id}(t) &= \\max\\lbrace(O_c ^\\text{id}(t))^{(0)},\\,0\\rbrace\\\\\nI_c ^\\text{id}(t) &= O_c ^\\text{id}(t) + \\Delta_c ^\\text{id}(t)\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{2.15}\\]\n\n\n2.2.3.2 Step 2: real balance\nReal flows are obtained from ideal ones (Equation 2.15) in such a way to satisfy the constraint:\n\\[\n\\sum _c O_c ^\\text{re}(t) = Q(t),\n\\tag{2.16}\\]\nwhere the right-hand side is the total ditch flow computed earlier (Section 2.2.2). At each time-step \\(t\\), the cluster’s index set is randomly permuted3, and the real flows are calculated as:\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\nO_c ^\\text{re}(t) &= \\min \\lbrace O_c ^\\text{re}(t),\\,Q(t)-\\sum_{c'&lt;c}O_{c'} ^\\text{re}(t) \\rbrace +\n\\dfrac{\\max \\lbrace 0, Q(t)-\\sum_{c'}O_{c'} ^\\text{re}(t)\\rbrace}{\\text{number of clusters}},\\\\\nI_c ^\\text{re}(t) &= \\max\\lbrace I_c ^\\text{id}(t)-O_c ^\\text{id}(t) + O_c ^\\text{re}(t),\\,0 \\rbrace\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{2.17}\\]\nIn words, clusters are emptied in a random order within the allowed capacity of the corresponding ditch (i.e. its actual total flow) - if the sum of ideal outflows is less than capacity, the remaining outflow is equally shared among clusters. Using Equation 2.17, we finally determine the real water level achieved as:\n\\[\nh_c^\\text{re}(t) = \\max(0,\\,h_c^\\text{re}(t-1)+\\text{P}(t)-\\text{ETP}(t)) + I_c ^\\text{re}(t)-O_c ^\\text{re}(t),\n\\tag{2.18}\\]\nto be compared with Equation 2.13.\n\n\n2.2.3.3 Step 3: updating the plan delay\nThe purpose of the plan delay \\(D_c(t)\\) is to allow all clusters to be emptied as required by the ideal management plan, which may be hindered on the originally scheduled days by the first of Equation 2.17, since this sets to zero the real outflows for some clusters whenever the ditch’s flow is saturated.\nThe updated value \\(D_c(t)\\) is obtained as follows. If \\(d(t)\\) (the actual day of year) is outside of the window \\(W = [\\text{20th of April},\\,\\text{15th of October}]\\), we reset all \\(D_c(t) = 0\\). Otherwise, if \\(h_c ^{\\text{id}}(t)&gt;0\\) or \\(h_c ^{\\text{re}}(t)&lt;H_{\\text{thres}}\\), the plan delay is unchanged for this cluster: \\(D_c(t) = D_c(t-1)\\). Finally, if \\(h_c ^{\\text{id}}(t)=0\\) but \\(h_c ^{\\text{re}}(t)&gt;H_{\\text{thres}}\\), we set \\(D_c(t) = D_c(t-1) + 1\\).",
