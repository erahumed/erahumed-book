    "text": "Mediterranean coastal wetlands are exposed to multiple anthropogenic pressures, one of the most significant being pollution from intensive rice production. Among the most critical pollutants associated with rice cultivation are synthetic pesticides, particularly herbicides, insecticides, and fungicides. Once applied in rice production, pesticides can be transported through spray-drift, surface runoff or leaching into nearby water bodies, threatening the structure and functioning of aquatic ecosystems.\nThe ERAHUMED Decision Support System (DSS) was designed to evaluate the exposure and risks of pesticides used in rice cultivation, focusing on the Albufera Natural Park as a reference and study wetland. The Albufera Natural Park, located near Valencia, Spain, is one of the most important wetlands in the Mediterranean region. It spans an area of 21 hectares, including the Albufera lagoon, surrounding marshlands, rice fields, and sand dunes. The freshwater lagoon is connected to the Mediterranean Sea through a system of canals known as “golas.” The park is a Ramsar site and hosts a wide variety of flora and fauna, including several endemic and endangered species.\nThe DSS dynamically calculates the volume of water available in rice fields, canals, and the lagoon throughout the year. Additionally, it can dynamically predict pesticide concentrations in various environmental matrices, including rice crops, surface water, and sediment. Finally, the DSS evaluates the risks associated with each pesticide and their mixtures for aquatic ecosystems, based on Species Sensitivity Distributions (SSDs).\nThe DSS can be used to predict exposure and risks associated with different pesticides, considering their unique physico-chemical and toxicological properties, at a landscape level. It determines spatially explicit and dynamic variations in concentrations within each water body over time. This makes it a valuable tool for decision-making regarding rice cultivation management and implementing risk mitigation measures at an ecosystem-wide scale. Furthermore, it allows for prospective ecological risk assessments of new substances and the identification of pollution hot-spots and the combined effects of complex contaminant mixtures.\nOn the practical side, the DSS is implemented as an R package called {erahumed}, distributed as open-source software and available for download here. The package includes a Graphical User Interface (GUI), implemented as a Shiny application, which allows users to run the models and analyze the results without directly interacting with the underlying R code.\nThis documentation provides a comprehensive description of the DSS and is divided into two main parts. The first part, Technical Description, outlines the models underlying the DSS, including the environmental, hydrological, and physico-chemical parameters required for its operation, as well as the processes and equations used to calculate exposure and risks. The second part, User Manual, provides step-by-step instructions for using the software, with a particular focus on its GUI. In addition, an Appendix details the data used by the DSS.",

    "text": "The ERAHUMED model for assessing the ecological status of the Albufera Natural Park consists of three key components:\nFrom a spatial perspective, the natural park is divided into three types of water bodies: the Albufera lake, rice field clusters1, and irrigation ditches, which hydrologically connect the lake to the fields. Each of the model’s computational layers incorporates specific quantitative models to simulate the relevant processes across all water bodies. This is summarized in Figure 3.1, where arrows indicate downstream dependencies and define the logical computation order.\nTo clarify this structure, we can summarize the role of each simulation layer in Figure 3.1 as follows:\nIn addition to the default simulation workflow, the ERAHUMED software includes advanced features that allow users to define custom chemical compounds and rice field management systems (RFMSs). While current agrochemical practices in the Albufera Natural Park are already built into the tool, these customization options greatly expand its capabilities. They enable the simulation and comparison of alternative scenarios, making the software a powerful resource for exploring potential changes in management or chemical use. Detailed guidance on how to define and allocate custom chemicals and RFMSs is provided in the following Sections.\nThe next Section provides a detailed description of all model inputs, including hydrological data, chemical properties, and management practices, which underpin the simulation layers described above.",

Such amount of recirculated water is hard to estimate and, in the lack of a better model, we simply assume this to be negligible, except when a positive amount is required by Equation 5.4 itself, due the physical constraint that \\(I_t \\geq 0\\).\nOnce \\(O_t\\) is calculated through Equation 5.5, \\(I_t\\) can be immediately obtained from Equation 5.4. Notice that whenever the aforementioned compensating outflow term due to water recirculation is included (which happens when the maximum in Eq. 5.5 is given by the second term), the total inflow is always estimated to be zero.\n\n\n5.4.2 Rice field clusters\nWater balance calculations for rice field clusters are complex due to the lack of observational data.

On the other hand, clusters are assumed to be irrigated from sources external the Albufera system, i.e., not through any of the ditches that eventually flow into the lake. According to our assumptions on the hydrology of clusters and ditches (cf. Section 5.3), the sum of cluster outflows is constrained by:\n\\[ \\sum _{c = 1} ^ {N_C} O_{c,t} \\leq Q_t  \\tag{5.7}\\]\nwhere \\(Q_t\\) denotes the inflow to the relevant ditch. With a small leap in logic, we anticipate from Section 5.4.3, that the water levels in irrigation ditches are assumed to be constant, so that \\(Q_t\\) can also be identified with the ditch outflow, that is in turn estimated as:\n\\[ Q_t = \\frac{\\text{Area of clusters draining into ditch}}{\\text{Area of all clusters}} \\times \\text{Lake's Inflow}_t  \\tag{5.8}\\]\nwhere the lake’s inflow is computed as described in Section 5.4.1.\nQualitatively speaking, the simulation determines daily values of \\(I_{c,t}\\) and \\(O_{c,t}\\) that satisfy Eqs. 5.6 and 5.7, and such that the resulting hydrology aligns as closely as possible with the “ideal” conditions prescribed by the specified management plan. This is accomplished in three steps:\n\nComputing ideal inflows and outflows based on current water levels and management plans.\nDetermining actual inflows and outflows, along with the corresponding actual water level changes.\n\nAdjusting management plan delays if some clusters were scheduled to be drained but could not be due to insufficient flow through the common ditch (see below for details).\n\nThese steps are iterated on a daily basis, starting from some initial time (say \\(t = 0\\)) at which all cluster water levels match the ideal ones, and no plan delays are present.\nConcerning the last step, a few words may serve to clarify the algorithm described below. The purpose of management plan delays is to ensure that during each year’s sowing season, all cluster’s are eventually emptied as required for ground applications of chemicals (modeled in subsequent layers of the simulation). This is achieved by postponing the management plan by one day whenever an emptying condition is not met. Outside of the sowing window, delays are reset to zero to prevent them from accumulating indefinitely, which would be unrealistic.\nIn what follows, the conversion between cluster water volumes and depths is provided by \\(V_{c,t} = A_c \\cdot h_{c,t}\\), and we denote by \\(\\delta_{c,t}\\) the time series of plan delays for cluster \\(c\\), which is initialized by \\(\\delta_{c,0} =0\\).\n\n5.4.2.1 Step 1: ideal balance\nIdeal balance quantities for each cluster \\(c\\) are obtained from the management plan data-set, whose relevant row is identified by the cluster’s rice variety \\(v\\) and field type \\(\\theta\\), and the delayed day:\n\\[\nd_{c,t+1} = d_{t+1}-\\delta_{c,t},\n\\tag{5.9}\\]\nwhere \\(d_{t+1}\\) denotes the day of year corresponding to time \\(t+1\\), and \\(\\delta_{c,t}\\) the accumulated plan delay.\nLet \\(h _{c,t+1}^{\\text{id}}\\) denote the ideal depth for cluster \\(c\\) at time \\(t+1\\) retrieved in this way, and \\(\\text{Ir}_{c,t}\\), \\(\\text{Dr}_{c,t}\\) the corresponding irrigation and draining plans. Furthermore, denote by \\(V_{c,t+1}^{\\text{id}} = A_c \\cdot h_{c,t+1}^{\\text{id}}\\) the corresponding ideal water volume.\nIn order to compute ideal inflow and outflow, we require (cf. Equation 5.6):\n\\[\nV_{c,t+1}^{\\text{id}} = \\max \\lbrace V_{c,t}^{\\text{id}}  + (\\text{P}_t-\\text{ETP}_t)\\times A_c,0 \\rbrace + I_{c,t}^{\\text{id}}-O_{c,t}^{\\text{id}}\n\\tag{5.10}\\]\nClearly, Equation 5.10 alone does not individually specify \\(I_{c,t}^{\\text{id}}\\) and \\(O_{c,t}^{\\text{id}}\\), but only their difference \\(\\Delta _{c,t}^{\\text{id}}= I_{c,t}^{\\text{id}}-O_{c,t}^{\\text{id}}\\). In order to fix both these quantities:\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\n(I_{c,t} ^\\text{id})^{(0)}&= \\begin{cases}\n  k_\\text{flow}  & \\text{if }\\text{Ir}_{c,t} = \\text{Dr}_{c,t} = 1 \\\\\n  0 & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases},\\\\\n(O_{c,t} ^\\text{id})^{(0)}&=(I_{c,t} ^\\text{id})^{(0)}-\\Delta _{c,t}^{\\text{id}}.\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{5.11}\\]\nand, in order to ensure that flows are positive, we finally set:\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\nO_{c,t} ^\\text{id} &= \\max\\lbrace(O_{c,t} ^\\text{id})^{(0)},\\,0\\rbrace\\\\\nI_{c,t} ^\\text{id} &= O_{c,t} ^\\text{id} + \\Delta _{c,t}^{\\text{id}},\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{5.12}\\]\nwhich satisfy Equation 5.10 and give rise to positive \\(O_{c,t}^\\text{id}\\) and \\(I_{c,t}^\\text{id}\\).\n\n\n5.4.2.2 Step 2: real balance\nAt each time-step \\(t\\), the cluster’s index set is randomly permuted 2, and the real flows are calculated as:\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\nO_{c,t} &= \\min \\lbrace O_{c,t}^\\text{id},\\,Q_t-\\sum_{c'&lt;c}O_{c',t} \\rbrace ,\\\\\nI_{c,t} &= \\max\\lbrace I_{c,t}^\\text{id}-O_{c,t}^\\text{id} + O_{c,t},\\,0 \\rbrace\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{5.13}\\]\nIn simple terms, clusters are emptied in a random order within the allowed capacity of the corresponding ditch. Using Equation 5.13, we finally determine the real water level achieved as:\n\\[\nV_{c,t+1} = \\max \\lbrace V_{c,t}  + (\\text{P}_t-\\text{ETP}_t)\\times A_c,0 \\rbrace + I_{c,t}-O_{c,t}\n\\tag{5.14}\\]\nto be compared with Equation 5.10.\n\n\n5.4.2.3 Step 3: updating the plan delay\nThe updated value \\(\\delta _{c,t+1}\\) is obtained as follows. If \\(d_{t+1}\\) (the actual day of year) is outside of the window \\(W = [\\text{20th of April},\\,\\text{15th of October}]\\), then \\(\\delta_{c,t+1} = 0\\). Otherwise, if \\(h_{c,t}^\\text{id} &gt; 0\\) or \\(h_{c,t} &lt; h_{\\text{thres}}\\), the plan delay is unchanged: \\(\\delta_{c,t+1} = \\delta_{c,t}\\). Finally, if \\(h_{c,t}^\\text{id} = 0\\) but \\(h_{c,t} &gt; h_{\\text{thres}}\\), we add one day of delay: \\(\\delta_{c,t+1} = \\delta_{c,t}+1\\).\n\n\n5.4.2.4 Step 3: updating the plan delay\nThe updated value \\(\\delta _{c,t+1}\\) is obtained as follows. If \\(d_{t+1}\\) (the actual day of year) is outside of the window \\(W = [\\text{20th of April},\\,\\text{15th of October}]\\), then \\(\\delta_{c,t+1} = 0\\). Otherwise, if \\(h_{c,t}^\\text{id} &gt; 0\\) or \\(h_{c,t} &lt; h_{\\text{thres}}\\), the plan delay is unchanged: \\(\\delta_{c,t+1} = \\delta_{c,t}\\). Finally, if \\(h_{c,t}^\\text{id} = 0\\) but \\(h_{c,t} &gt; h_{\\text{thres}}\\), we add one day of delay: \\(\\delta_{c,t+1} = \\delta_{c,t}+1\\).\n\n\n\n5.4.3 Irrigation ditches\nOur approach to the hydrology of irrigation ditches is simplified, with the main assumption being that all ditches have a common, constant water depth \\(h_\\text{ditch}\\) corresponding to the input parameter ditch_level_m.\nUsing the index \\(D =1,2,\\dots,26\\) to enumerate the park’s main ditches, ditch outflows to the Albufera lake \\(O_{D,t}\\) are calculated according to Equation 5.8. These outflows also coincide with the total ditch inflows \\(I_{D,t}\\) (due to the constant water volume assumption).",

    "text": "6.1 Pesticide applications\nThis Chapter describes how ERAHUMED models pesticide exposure in the Albufera Natural Park. The hydrological simulation discussed in the previous Chapter provides the foundation for this analysis, as water serves as the primary medium for pesticide transport. Here, we outline how ERAHUMED simulates the introduction, dispersion, and fate of pesticides within the system. This includes processes such as deposition, degradation, and transfer between water bodies. By integrating hydrological dynamics with chemical behavior, the model estimates exposure levels over time and space, supporting risk assessment efforts.\nThe simulation of pesticide applications to rice fields follows a straightforward algorithm that takes as input the scheduled application list and the system’s hydrology (Chapter 5). The algorithm outputs a list of actual applications, specifying the application day and the applied mass. Since the application of each pesticide is computed independently of others, we focus on a single pesticide for the present discussion.\nThe information on scheduled applications is contained in the ca_schedules_df data frame, whose structure is described in detail in Section 4.3.4. For each scheduled application, this data set specifies:\nTo determine the actual application date, we proceed as follows (for notation related to cluster hydrology, see Section 5.4.2):\nThese steps are repeated for all subsequent applications of a given pesticide in a given cluster. It is worth noting that the algorithm for simulating the cluster hydrological balance (Section 5.4.2) guarantees that at least one candidate application day will always remain available in the final selection step.",

    "text": "6.2 Pesticide dispersion\nAs illustrated in our hydrological model (Figure 5.1), pesticides applied to rice field clusters are transported through water flow into ditches, then into the Albufera lake, and ultimately to the sea.\nFrom a mathematical perspective, the fate of these chemicals is governed by a system of differential equations that captures key physico-chemical processes, including transport, diffusion between compartments, and degradation.\nThe remainder of this chapter describes our approach to pesticide dispersion. We define the simplified differential system used to model these processes in Section 6.2.2, and we present our semi-analytic solution method in Section 6.2.3.\n\n6.2.1 Diagram of physical processes\nThe schematic diagram below illustrates the processes captured by our model for chemical dispersion. Directional arrows represent the transfer of chemical matter among the three compartments considered—Foliage, Water, and Soil—as well as exchanges with external water bodies (denoted as “Watercourse”).\nWhile the overall scheme applies to all landscape elements, specific details vary for clusters, ditches, and the lake (cf. the hydrological model of Figure 5.1):\n\nClusters: Inflow waters originate outside the system and are assumed to be free of pesticides.\nDitches and the Albufera lake: No direct pesticide applications occur in these areas, meaning the foliage compartment plays no role in their dynamics.\nDitches: Receive inflows from two sources—clusters, which contribute pesticide-laden water, and external sources, which are assumed to be free of chemicals.\nAlbufera lake: Its only inflows come from ditches, which contain nonzero chemical concentrations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.1: Scheme of physical processes considered in ERAHUMED model of chemical dispersion\n\n\n\n\n\n6.2.2 Evolution Equations\nAs in Section 6.1, we focus on a single pesticide and a fixed hydrological element (e.g., a cluster). We denote its masses in the three compartments—foliage, water, and sediment—by \\(m_f\\), \\(m_w\\), and \\(m_s\\), respectively. We assume that, at any given time, these masses are fully diluted and homogeneously distributed. In particular, we can meaningfully define spatially constant concentrations \\(c_f\\) and \\(c_s\\) in the water1 and sediment compartments.\nWe first describe the differential system that drives the temporal dynamics of \\(m_f\\), \\(m_w\\) and \\(m_s\\). The correspondence between the parameters used in this and the following Section is provided in Section 6.2.4.\nThe fundamental equations describing pesticide diffusion are given as follows:\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\dfrac{\\text d{m}_f}{\\text d t} & = -(k_f+w)m_f+a_f\\\\\n\\dfrac{\\text d{m}_w}{\\text d t} & = -(k_w+d_w+s+\\frac{O}{V})m_w+d_sm_s+wm_f+a_w-\\sigma(\\frac{m_w}{\\rho V}) \\\\\n\\dfrac{\\text d{m}_s}{\\text d t} & = (d_w+s)m_w-(k_s+d_s)m_s+a_s+\\sigma(\\frac{m_w}{\\rho V})\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{6.1}\\]\nwhere:\n\n\\(a_{f,w,s}\\) are the mass income rates of the chemical in the three compartments, that include direct pesticide application and mass coming from inflows.\n\\(k_{f,w,s}\\) are the degradation rates of the chemical in the three compartments,\n\\(d_w\\) and \\(d_s\\) are the water-sediment diffusion rates,\n\\(s\\) is the settling rate,\n\\(w\\) is the washout rate,\n\\(O\\) is the outflow rate of the rice field,\n\\(V\\) is the volume of water in the rice field,\n\\(\\rho\\) is the chemical solubility in water,\n\\(\\sigma(x)\\) is a function (not further specified, see below) that grows quickly for \\(x &gt; 1\\), and vanishes for \\(x \\leq 1\\). This function accounts for solubility.\n\nStrictly speaking, all these terms have instantaneous time dependence2. Apart from making the system 6.1 hard to attack by analytic means, such a dependence is troubling because we don’t have access to the exact time dependence of the majority of these terms (e.g. outflow, volume or chemical applications), our input consisting of simple daily average/cumulative values. On the other hand, if all the terms were constant, and if we could neglect \\(\\sigma\\), the solution of Equation 6.1 would be immediate, as the corresponding system becomes a linear ODE with constant coefficients, in addition whose eigenvalues and eigenvectors can be computed explicitly.\nWhat we use in practice is an intermediate semi-analytic approach that allows us to compute daily values of \\(m_{f,w,s}\\), which is described next.\n\n\n6.2.3 Semi-analytic solution of Equation 6.1\nThe time evolution of \\(m_{f,w,s}\\) in a daily time-step (from \\(t\\) to \\(t+1\\), say, assuming \\(t\\) is measured in days) is obtained through the following four consecutive stages:\n\nWe compute the exact evolution of \\(m_{f,w,s}\\) according to the linear ODE obtained by disregarding the processes of outflow, chemical application and solubility, and using daily constant values for all the remaining constants involved (described in more detail below).\nWe compute the \\(m_w\\) losses due to outflow as if they happened instantaneously after the processes computed in the previous step took place, with the water volume of the rice paddy varying from \\(V(t+1)+O(t)\\) to \\(V(t+1)\\).\nWe compute the mass applications again as instantaneous, after the losses in the water compartment due to outflows took place.\nWe compare the resulting \\(m_w\\) with the maximum amount allowed by the solubility in water, that is \\(m_w ^{\\text{max}}(t) = \\rho V(t+1)\\) and transfer any excess to the sediment compartment (\\(m_s\\)).\n\nIn the following, we describe in full detail the computations involved in these four steps.\n\n6.2.3.1 Step 1: linear ODE evolution (physico-chemical processes)\nDisregarding outflow, mass application and solubility, we get a linear ODE of the form:\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\dfrac{\\text d{m}_f}{\\text d t} & = \\gamma m_f,\\\\\n\\dfrac{\\text d{m}_w}{\\text d t} & = a_{ww} m_w+a_{ws}m_s + w m_f, \\\\\n\\dfrac{\\text d{m}_s}{\\text d t} & = a_{sw}m_w+a_{ss}m_s,\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{6.2}\\]\nwith:\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\gamma                  &= -(k_f + w),\\\\\na_{ww}                  &= - (k_w + d_ w +s)\\\\\na_{ws}                  &= d_s\\\\\na_{sw}                  &= d_w+s\\\\\na_{ss}                  &= -(k_s+d_s)\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{6.3}\\]\nwhere the various physico-chemical parameters are assumed to be constant during a daily time-step (cf. Section 6.2.4).\nThe evolution of \\(m_f\\) is easily obtained:\n\\[\nm_f(t) = e^{\\gamma t}m_f(0).\n\\tag{6.4}\\]\nPlugging this into the three-dimensional system 6.2 we obtain a reduced two-dimensional system for the water-sediment compartments:\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\dfrac{\\text d{m}_w}{\\text d t} & = a_{ww} m_w+a_{ws}m_s + w e ^{\\gamma t}m_f(0), \\\\\n\\dfrac{\\text d{m}_s}{\\text d t} & = a_{sw}m_w+a_{ss}m_s,\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{6.5}\\]\nwhich is solved explicitly with standard methods3.\n\n\n6.2.3.2 Step 2: mass losses due to outflow\nMass losses due to outflow are computed as if the outflow process happened instantaneously after the processes discussed in the previous step took place. The amount of mass in the water compartment is affected as follows:\n\\[\nm_w \\to \\frac{V_f}{V_i} m_w,\n\\tag{6.6}\\]\nwhere \\(V_i\\) and \\(V_f\\) denote the initial and final volume for the outflow process. Here \\(V_f\\) coincides with the simulated value \\(V(t+1)\\) for the relevant water body and \\(V_i = V_f + O(t)\\), where \\(O(t)\\) denotes the total simulated outflow for day \\(t\\).\n\n\n6.2.3.3 Step 3: mass income from direct application and inflows\nThese contributions are computed as instantaneous and subsequent to outflow. Masses in the various compartments (\\(i = f,\\,w,\\,s\\)) are modified as follows: \\[\nm_i \\to m_i + a_i\n\\tag{6.7}\\]\nAs mentioned above, \\(a_i\\) accounts for both direct pesticide applications and water inflow, that is:\n\\[\na_i = a_i ^{\\text{app}} + a_i ^{\\text{inflow}}\n\\] The calculation of direct application rates from input parameters is described below. As to the second term, the amount of incoming mass is exactly given by the amount of outgoing mass in the outflow of the preceding element along the water course chain, which is computed as detailed in the previous Section.\n\n\n6.2.3.4 Step 4: solubility\nThe chemical density in the water compartment after Steps 1, 2, and 3 is eventually compared with the chemical’s solubility \\(\\rho\\), and any mass excess is instantaneously transferred to the sediment compartment. This implies the following modifications:\n\\[\nm_s \\to m_s + \\max(0, \\,m_w - \\rho V(t+1)),\\quad m_w\\to\\max(m_w,\\,\\rho V(t+1)).\n\\tag{6.8}\\]\n\n\n\n6.2.4 Input parameters (correspondence with Chapter 4)\nThis Section describes the sources of the various numerical inputs to Equation 6.1.\n\n6.2.4.1 Pesticide application rates\nApplication rates are given by:\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\na_f^{\\text{app}} &= A(t)\\cdot (1-\\text{drift})\\cdot c(t),\\\\\na_s^{\\text{app}} &= A(t)\\cdot (1-\\text{drift})(1-c(t))I(h(t+1)\\neq0),\\\\\na_w^{\\text{app}} &= A(t)\\cdot (1-\\text{drift})\\cdot(1-\\text{SNK})(1-c(t))I(h(t+1)=0),\\\\\n\\end{split}\n\\] Here, \\(A(t)\\) is the applied amount on day \\(t\\), whose computation was described in this chapter; \\(I(h(t+1)=0)\\) is equal to one if the water level of the cluster \\(h(t+1) =0\\), and vanishes otherwise4; the quantities \\(\\text{drift}\\), \\(\\text{SNK}\\) correspond to the internal drift and SNK parameters (cf. Chapter 4); finally \\(c\\) is the coverage fraction, computed as:\n\\[\nc = \\min\\left[\\frac{d_s(t)}{j_{\\text{grow}}},\\,1\\right]\\cdot c_{\\text{max}},\n\\] where \\(d_s(t)\\) is the number of days elapsed from seeding, assumed to be on the 20th of April, while \\(j_\\text{grow}\\) and \\(c_\\text{max}\\) correspond to the input parameters jgrow and covmax.\n\n\n6.2.4.2 Degradation rates\nDaily degradation rates \\(k_{f,w,s}(t)\\) for the chemical are modeled through the Arrhenius equation, schematically:\n\\[\nk(t) = k_0 \\cdot Q_{10}^{\\frac{T(t)-T_0}{10}}\n\\] where \\(k_0\\) is the degradation rate \\(k_0\\) at a reference temperature \\(T_0\\), \\(Q_{10}\\) is a numerical constant, and \\(T(t)\\) is the average temperature on day \\(t\\). The constants \\(k_0\\) and \\(Q_10\\) are internal model parameters, while \\(T(t)\\) is given by weather_df$temperature_ave, see Section 4.3.1.\n\n\n6.2.4.3 Diffusion rates\nDiffusion rates are given by:\n\\[\nd_w(t) = \\frac{k_\\text{dif}\\cdot f_{D,w}}{h(t)}, \\quad d_s = \\frac{k_\\text{dif}\\cdot f_{D,s}}{h_{\\text{act}}\\cdot \\text{pos}}\n\\] where \\(h(t)\\) is the water depth of the hydrological element; \\(h_\\text{act}\\) is the depth of active sediment, corresponding to the input parameter dact_m; \\(text{pos}\\) is the porosity, and is expressed in terms of input parameters as fc - wilting; \\(k_\\text{dif}\\) is given by the empirical formula (see TODO):\n\\[\nk_\\text{dif} = \\left( \\frac{69.35}{365} - \\text{pos}\\cdot M^{-2/3} \\right)\\frac{\\text{m}}{\\text{day}}\n\\] where \\(M\\) is the molecular weight of the chemical (internal parameter); finally, \\(f_{D,w}\\) and \\(f_{D,s}\\) are given by:\n\n\n6.2.4.4 Settling rate\nThe daily settling rate is computed as:\n\\[\ns(t) = \\dfrac{k_s(1-f_{D,w})}{h(t)}\n\\] where \\(k_s\\) is a (chemical-specific) internal parameter.\n\n\n6.2.4.5 Washout rate\nThe daily washout rate is computed as:\n\\[\nw(t) = \\text{fet} \\cdot P(t)\n\\] where \\(P(t)\\) is the daily precipitation per unit area, while \\(\\text{fet}\\) is a (chemical-specific) internal parameter.\n\n\n6.2.4.6 Solubility\nThe solubility \\(\\rho\\) of chemical is an internal parameter.",

As described in [TODO], chemicals are grouped by toxic mode of action (TMoA), and different TMoAs are assumed to act independently.\nSeparate distributions are used to assess acute and chronic risks. In the case of acute risk, we use daily chemical concentration values (computed as described in Chapter 6). For chronic risk, we use a 21-day rolling average of concentrations.\nThe parameters of each SSD, as well as the TMoA classification for each chemical, are internal to ERAHUMED and are not directly accessible to the user.",

    "text": "8.1 How to run the GUI\nThe easiest way to run a simulation with ERAHUMED is through its Graphical User Interface (GUI), which we describe in this chapter. The GUI provides an intuitive way to configure all model inputs described in Chapter 4 and includes predefined visualizations for main model outputs. This makes it an efficient tool for exploring the ecosystem’s behavior and analyzing its sensitivity to different scenarios. Additionally, users can export output data for further analysis outside the Decision Support System (DSS).\nThe GUI is part of a broader software package—an R library—which we describe in detail in Chapter 9. If the screenshots in this chapter differ from the interface you see, check the version number (displayed within the GUI) to ensure you are working with the same release.\nAt the present moment, the GUI can only be run from R, through the package {erahumed}, which is publicly available on Github. Details on R and on the {erahumed} package are provided in Chapter 9 and references therein (see, in particular, Sections 9.1 and 9.2 for instructions on how to install R and the {erahumed} package). Once you have installed {erahumed}, you can access its GUI by running in R the following command:\nerahumed::launch_dss()",

    "text": "8.2 The Output tab\nUpon launching the GUI, you are greeted by the Output tab (Figure 8.1), which serves as the main dashboard for viewing model results through interactive visualizations. Generating the plots may take around 10 to 20 seconds, corresponding to the time required to complete a full simulation for a one-year period.\nThe dashboard is divided into three sections, each corresponding to a model component:\n\nHydrology (Chapter 5): Displays water level variations and flow patterns over time.\nExposure (Chapter 6): Shows the concentration of different pesticides in water and sediment.\nRisk (Chapter 7): Assesses potential ecological impacts based on pesticide exposure.\n\nUsers can explore these components across different hydrological elements of the Albufera Natural Park, including the Albufera lake, irrigation ditches, and rice field clusters. The specific location can be selected using the “Water body” dropdown menu. The interactive plots allow users to zoom, pan, and filter data over specific time periods, facilitating a more detailed analysis of model outputs.\nThe “Download results” button, located in the top-right corner, exports all raw model outputs as a compressed .zip file containing .csv data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.1: Graphical User Interface - Output tab\n\n\n\nThe visualizations in this tab reflect the selected input parameters. Adjusting inputs in the Input tab described in the next Section allows users to explore different scenarios and assess their impact on model outcomes.",

    "text": "9.1 Installing R\nAs mentioned in Chapter 8, the software infrastructure of the ERAHUMED DSS is a library for the R programming language. The {erahumed} R package already has extensive documentation, which you can consult on its main website. In particular, this article provides a step-by-step guide to the package’s main functionalities, explaining how to run a simulation.\nThe rest of this chapter provides brief instructions on installing R and the {erahumed} package. If you are a proficient R user, you may confidently skip this part and simply follow the instructions in the package README to install {erahumed} and launch the Shiny app that provides its GUI.\nThe {erahumed} R package is open-source software and is hosted on GitHub. If you have a suggestion, want to report a bug, or need help, feel free to open a GitHub issue (you will need to sign in to GitHub with a personal account, which you can create for free). Pull requests with code improvements are also welcome!\nR is a free programming language and software environment widely adopted in the scientific community due to its powerful statistical capabilities and user-friendly interface. The {erahumed} package allows users to run simulations, prepare custom inputs, and explore outputs in detail—all from the R command line. Compared to the graphical user interface (GUI), using R directly provides greater flexibility and control over these operations.\nTo install R, visit the official R project website, where you will find detailed installation instructions for various operating systems. If you are new to R, there are many introductory resources available online, including the official R manual from the R Core Team. However, if your only goal is to run the ERAHUMED GUI on your local machine, you won’t need extensive knowledge of R. Simply installing R and running a few commands in the command line will be enough to get started.",
