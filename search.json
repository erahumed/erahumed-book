    "text": "3.2 HBA: Hydrological Balance of the Albufera lake\nThe purpose of this model component is to compute the total daily inflow to the Albufera lake. The relevant equation expressing the hydrological balance is:\n\\[\n\\text{Volume Change} = \\text{Inflow} - \\text{Outflow} + \\text{Precipitation} - \\text{Evapotranspiration}\n\\tag{3.1}\\]\nwhere the unknown is \\(\\text{Inflow}\\), whereas the remaining terms are obtained from observational data, as described in the previous Section (Section 3.1).\n\n3.2.1 Input\nThe inputs specific to this layer are two numerical functions converting water heights into the water volumes that appear in Equation 3.1. Specifically:\n\nThe lake’s storage curve converts the measured lake’s level into a total water volume.\nThe precipitation-evapotranspiration volume function (or, for the sake of brevity, P-ETP function), that converts precipitation and evapotranspiration values per unit area into an overall water volume difference.\n\nEven though the R interface to the ERAHUMED software allows arbitrary definitions, the graphical user interface assumes a linear approximation for both these functions. Therefore, the storage curve is assumed to take the form:\n\\[\nV_t = m \\cdot L_t + q,\n\\tag{3.2}\\] where \\(V_t\\) is the (daily) water volume of the lake, \\(L_t\\) the corresponding water level (cf. Table 3.1), and \\(m\\) and \\(q\\) are numerical coefficients1. Correspondingly, the P-ETP function reads:\n\\[\n\\Delta V_t ^{\\text{P-ETP}} = \\alpha \\cdot \\text{P}_t - \\beta\\cdot \\text{ETP}_t,\n\\tag{3.3}\\] where the left-hand side represents the relevant water volume difference, whereas the \\(\\text{P}\\) and \\(\\text{ETP}\\) terms in the right-hand side are the measured precipitation and evapotranspiration levels per unit area (cf. Table 3.1). The actual default values of \\(m\\), \\(q\\), \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) are documented in Appendix A.4.\n\n\n3.2.2 Output\nThe output of this model consists of the time-series collected in the table below.\n\n\n\nTable 3.2: HBA model component outputs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nUnits\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\\(V_t\\)\n\\(\\text{m}^3\\)\nLake water volume\n\n\n\\(I_t\\)\n\\(\\text{m}^3\\)\nLake total inflow\n\n\n\\(O_t\\)\n\\(\\text{m}^3\\)\nLake total outflow\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.3 Details\nUsing the notation introduced in the previous Subsections, we can rewrite Equation 3.1 as follows:\n\\[\nV_{t+1} - V_t = I_t -O_t +\\Delta V^{\\text {ETP}}_t,\n\\tag{3.4}\\]\nwhere \\(V_t\\) and \\(\\Delta V^{\\text {ETP}}_t\\) are computed through the storage and P-ETP functions, as in Eqs. 3.2 and 3.3. The only terms that requires further clarification in Equation 3.4 is \\(O_t\\), the total outflow from the lake.\nStrictly speaking, \\(O_t\\) is not merely the sum of \\(O_t^{\\text{Pujol}}\\), \\(O_t^{\\text{Perelló}}\\) and \\(O_t^{\\text{Perellonet}}\\), but is rather calculated as follows:\n\\[\nO_t = \\max\n\\left[\nO_t^{\\text{Pujol}} + O_t^{\\text{Perelló}} + O_t^{\\text{Perellonet}},\\,\n\\Delta V^{\\text {ETP}}_t+V_t-V_{t+1}\n\\right].\n\\tag{3.5}\\]\nThe rationale is that the simple sum of estuaries outflows omits potentially important contributions from water recirculation, that is to say, water being pumped out from the lake for rice-field irrigation, by the so-called tancats. Such amount of recirculated water is hard to estimate and, in the lack of a better model, we simply assume this to be negligible, except when a positive amount is required by Equation 3.4 itself, due the physical constraint that \\(I_t \\geq 0\\).\nOnce \\(O_t\\) is calculated through Equation 3.5, \\(I_t\\) can be immediately obtained from Equation 3.4. Notice that whenever the aforementioned compensating outflow term due to water recirculation is included (which happens when the maximum in Eq. 3.5 is given by the second term), the total inflow is always estimated to be zero.",

    "text": "3.3 HBP: Hydrological Balance of rice Paddy clusters\nThis modeling layer simulates the local hydrology (i.e. water levels, inflows and outflows) of rice paddy clusters in the Albufera National Park. The simulation, that literally involves the generation of a synthetic data-set, is based on:\n\nThe hydrology of the Albufera lake, which allows to constrain the total outflow of all rice paddies, assumed to be equal to the lake’s total inflow (the main output of the HBA layer, see Section 3.2).\nAn estimate of the fraction of the total lake’s inflow that comes from each of the 26 ditches that flow into the Albufera.\nA subdivision of the rice fields surface into clusters that are assumed to be hydrologically connected with a single ditch - meaning that the sum of outflows of clusters from the same group must equal the total flow through the corresponding ditch.\nAn ideal yearly management plan for the irrigation and draining of rice paddies.\n\n\n3.3.1 Input\nAs already mentioned, the simulation is based on a spatial clustering, which is described in greater detail in Appendix A.5. For the present purposes, we stress that each cluster, consists of rice paddies of a definite rice variety, is labeled according to whether it is a tancat or not, and, most importantly, is assumed to be hydrologically connected with a single ditch.\nThe yearly management plan for these clusters, is described in Appendix A.3, and provides, for each day of the year \\(d\\), the following:\n\n\\(\\text{Ir}_d\\): boolean expressing whether the cluster is supposed to be irrigated (if true) on day of year \\(d\\).\n\\(\\text{Dr}_d\\): boolean expressing whether the cluster is supposed to be drained (if true) on day of year \\(d\\).\n\\(\\mathcal H _d\\): ideal water level (in \\(\\text{cm}\\)) of the cluster on day of year \\(d\\).\n\nAs explained in Appendix A.3, the management plan depends on the rice variety and on the tancat label of a cluster.\nIn addition to these rather complex inputs, the model component requires the following numerical parameters:\n\n\\(k_\\text{flow}\\) (Ideal flow rate). Rate at which water flows through rice paddies when these are being simultaneously irrigated and drained, with the overall level being kept constant. Expressed in \\(\\text{cm}\\cdot\\text{day}^{-1}\\).\n\\(h_{\\text{thres}}\\) (Height threshold). Maximum allowed water level for a cluster to be considered emptied, used in the calculation of draining/irrigation plan delays. Expressed in \\(\\text{cm}\\).\n\nFinally, it should be noted that the simulation involves random sampling (see Subsection 3.3.3), so that the seed of random number generation is an additional pseudo-parameter.\n\n\n3.3.2 Output\nThe output of this layer provides a simulation for the local hydrology of each cluster, summarized in the table below\n\n\n\nTable 3.3: HBP model component outputs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nUnits\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\\(h_{c,t}\\)\n\\(\\text{m}^3\\)\nCluster’s water height\n\n\n\\(I_{c,t}\\)\n\\(\\text{m}^3\\)\nCluster’s inflow\n\n\n\\(O_{c,t}\\)\n\\(\\text{m}^3\\)\nCluster’s outflow\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3.3 Detail\n\n3.3.3.1 Ditch inflows\nThe first step consists in breaking down the total inflow to the lake, obtained through Equation 3.1, into inflows from individual ditches. Each paddy cluster is assumed to communicate with a single ditch (cf. Section A.5), and the flow through a ditch is assumed to be proportional to the total area of clusters belonging to said ditch. Therefore, denoting by \\(I_i\\) and \\(A_i\\) the inflow and area of ditch \\(i\\), and by \\(I\\) the total inflow, we compute:\n\\[\nI_i = \\frac{A_i}{\\sum _j A_j} \\cdot I\n\\tag{3.6}\\]\n\n\n3.3.3.2 Main Algorithm\nIn the following, we focus on the set of clusters that communicate with a specific ditch, whose inflow (estimated according to Section 3.3.3.1) we denote by \\(Q\\). The essence of the algorithm is to approximate as closely as possible the cluster’s ideal inflows and outflows, with the constraint that the sum of the actual outflows from all clusters must equal \\(Q\\).\nLet us start by setting up some basic notation. We denote by:\n\\[\nh_c ^\\text{id}(t),\\quad I_c ^\\text{id}(t),\\quad O_c ^\\text{id}(t),\n\\tag{3.7}\\]\nthe ideal water level, inflow and outflow of cluster \\(c\\) at time (i.e. day) \\(t\\), and by:\n\\[\nh_c ^\\text{re}(t),\\quad I_c ^\\text{re}(t),\\quad O_c ^\\text{re}(t),\n\\tag{3.8}\\]\nthe corresponding real quantities. The area of cluster \\(c\\), that provides the conversion between water volumes and column heights, is denoted by \\(A_c\\). Precipitation and evapotranspiration water column values are denoted by:\n\\[\n\\text{P}(t),\\quad \\text{ETP}(t).\n\\tag{3.9}\\]\nFinally, we will define below a plan delay accumulated for cluster \\(c\\) at time \\(t\\), denoted \\(D_c(t)\\). This is computed recursively along the iterations of the algorithm, and its role will be clarified below.\nThe local balance algorithm proceeds iteratively as follows. At day \\(t\\), assume that \\(h_c ^\\text{re}(t-1)\\) and \\(D(t-1)\\) have already been computed; a single iteration consists of the following steps, which we describe in full detail below:\n\nStep 1. Recovering the \\(h_c ^\\text{id}(t)\\), \\(I_c ^\\text{id}(t)\\) and \\(O_c ^\\text{id}(t)\\) from the irrigation and draining plan, applying the computed plan delay \\(D_c(t-1)\\).\n\n\nStep 2. Computing \\(h_c ^\\text{re}(t)\\), \\(I_c ^\\text{re}(t)\\) and \\(O_c ^\\text{re}(t)\\) enforcing the constraint \\(\\sum _c O_c ^\\text{re}(t) = Q(t)\\).\nStep 3. Computing the updated plan delays \\(D_c(t)\\).\n\nIn order to initialize the iteration, we assume that at some initial time, say \\(t = 0\\), we have \\(D_c(t=0) = 0\\) \\(h_c ^\\text{re}(t=0) = h_c ^\\text{id}(t=1)\\).\n\n3.3.3.2.1 Step 1: ideal balance\nThe management data-set described Section A.3 provides the ideal water level for each cluster and for every day of the year. Denoting by \\(d(t)\\) the day of the year corresponding to \\(t\\), the relevant entry of the management data-set is that corresponding to day:\n\\[\nd^\\prime_c(t) = d(t) - D_c(t-1),\n\\tag{3.10}\\]\nwhere \\(D_c(t-1)\\) is the accumulated plan delay for thi cluster. Therefore we set:\n\\[\nh_c^\\text{id}(t) = \\text{Planned water level on day of year }d_c^\\prime(t).\n\\tag{3.11}\\]\nTo compute ideal inflow and outflow, we require:\n\\[\nh_c^\\text{id}(t) = \\max(0,\\,h_c^\\text{re}(t-1)+\\text{P}(t)-\\text{ETP}(t)) + I_c ^\\text{id}(t)-O_c ^\\text{id}(t),\n\\tag{3.12}\\]\nwhere we assume \\(I_c ^\\text{id}(t) &gt;0\\) and \\(O_c ^\\text{id}(t)&gt;0\\). Clearly, Equation 3.12 alone does not individually specify \\(I_c ^\\text{id}(t)\\) and \\(O_c ^\\text{id}(t)\\), but only their difference \\(\\Delta _c (t) = I_c ^\\text{id}(t) - O_c ^\\text{id}(t)\\). In order to fix both these quantities, we first define2:\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\n(I_c ^\\text{id}(t))^{(0)}&= \\begin{cases}\n  k  & \\text{cluster planned to be in flux on day of year } d_c^\\prime(t) \\\\\n  0 & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases},\\\\\n(O_c ^\\text{id}(t))^{(0)}&=(I_c ^\\text{id}(t))^{(0)}-\\Delta_c(t).\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{3.13}\\]\nand, in order to ensure that flows are positive3, we finally set:\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\nO_c ^\\text{id}(t) &= \\max\\lbrace(O_c ^\\text{id}(t))^{(0)},\\,0\\rbrace\\\\\nI_c ^\\text{id}(t) &= O_c ^\\text{id}(t) + \\Delta_c ^\\text{id}(t)\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{3.14}\\]\n\n\n3.3.3.2.2 Step 2: real balance\nReal flows are obtained from ideal ones (Equation 3.14) in such a way to satisfy the constraint:\n\\[\n\\sum _c O_c ^\\text{re}(t) = Q(t),\n\\tag{3.15}\\]\nwhere the right-hand side is the total ditch flow computed earlier (Section 3.3.3.1). At each time-step \\(t\\), the cluster’s index set is randomly permuted4, and the real flows are calculated as:\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\nO_c ^\\text{re}(t) &= \\min \\lbrace O_c ^\\text{re}(t),\\,Q(t)-\\sum_{c'&lt;c}O_{c'} ^\\text{re}(t) \\rbrace +\n\\dfrac{\\max \\lbrace 0, Q(t)-\\sum_{c'}O_{c'} ^\\text{re}(t)\\rbrace}{\\text{number of clusters}},\\\\\nI_c ^\\text{re}(t) &= \\max\\lbrace I_c ^\\text{id}(t)-O_c ^\\text{id}(t) + O_c ^\\text{re}(t),\\,0 \\rbrace\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{3.16}\\]\nIn words, clusters are emptied in a random order within the allowed capacity of the corresponding ditch (i.e. its actual total flow) - if the sum of ideal outflows is less than capacity, the remaining outflow is equally shared among clusters. Using Equation 3.16, we finally determine the real water level achieved as:\n\\[\nh_c^\\text{re}(t) = \\max(0,\\,h_c^\\text{re}(t-1)+\\text{P}(t)-\\text{ETP}(t)) + I_c ^\\text{re}(t)-O_c ^\\text{re}(t),\n\\tag{3.17}\\]\nto be compared with Equation 3.12.\n\n\n3.3.3.2.3 Step 3: updating the plan delay\nThe purpose of the plan delay \\(D_c(t)\\) is to allow all clusters to be emptied as required by the ideal management plan, which may be hindered on the originally scheduled days by the first of Equation 3.16, since this sets to zero the real outflows for some clusters whenever the ditch’s flow is saturated.\nThe updated value \\(D_c(t)\\) is obtained as follows. If \\(d(t)\\) (the actual day of year) is outside of the window \\(W = [\\text{20th of April},\\,\\text{15th of October}]\\), we reset all \\(D_c(t) = 0\\). Otherwise, if \\(h_c ^{\\text{id}}(t)&gt;0\\) or \\(h_c ^{\\text{re}}(t)&lt;H_{\\text{thres}}\\), the plan delay is unchanged for this cluster: \\(D_c(t) = D_c(t-1)\\). Finally, if \\(h_c ^{\\text{id}}(t)=0\\) but \\(h_c ^{\\text{re}}(t)&gt;H_{\\text{thres}}\\), we set \\(D_c(t) = D_c(t-1) + 1\\).",

    "text": "3.5 CT: Chemical Transport\nThis model component describes the evolution of chemical masses in the three compartments of foliage, water and sediment.

This function accounts for solubility. (TODO: motivate the inclusion of exactly these processes)\n\nStrictly speaking, all these terms have instantaneous time dependence5. Apart from making the system 3.18 hard to attack by analytic means, such a dependence is troubling because we don’t have access to the exact time dependence of the majority of these terms (e.g. outflow, volume or chemical applications), our input consisting of simple daily average/cumulative values. On the other hand, if all the terms were constant, and if we could neglect \\(\\sigma\\), the solution of Equation 3.18 would be immediate, as the corresponding system becomes a linear ODE with constant coefficients, in addition whose eigenvalues and eigenvectors can be computed explicitly.\nWhat we use in practice is an intermediate semi-analytic approach that allows us to compute daily values of \\(m_{f,w,s}\\), which we can briefly summarize as follows. The time evolution of \\(m_{f,w,s}\\) in a daily time-step (from \\(t\\) to \\(t+1\\), say, assuming \\(t\\) is measured in days) is obtained through the following four consecutive stages:\n\nWe compute the exact evolution of \\(m_{f,w,s}\\) according to the linear ODE obtained by disregarding the processes of outflow, chemical application and solubility, and using daily constant values for all the remaining constants involved (described in more detail below).\nWe compute the \\(m_w\\) losses due to outflow as if they happened instantaneously after the processes computed in the previous step took place, with the water volume of the rice paddy varying from \\(V(t)+O(t)\\) to \\(V(t)\\)6\n\nWe compute the mass applications again as instantaneous, after the losses in the water compartment due to outflows took place.\nWe compare the resulting \\(m_w\\) with the maximum amount allowed by the solubility in water, that is \\(m_w ^{\\text{max}}(t) = \\rho V(t)\\) and transfer any excess to the sediment compartment (\\(m_s\\)).\n\nIn the following, we describe in full detail the computations involved in these four steps.\n\n3.5.3.1 Step 1. Linear ODE evolution (physico-chemical processes)\nDisregarding outflow, mass application and solubility, we get a linear ODE of the form:\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\dfrac{\\text d{m}_f}{\\text d t} & = \\gamma m_f,\\\\\n\\dfrac{\\text d{m}_w}{\\text d t} & = a_{ww} m_w+a_{ws}m_s + w m_f, \\\\\n\\dfrac{\\text d{m}_s}{\\text d t} & = a_{sw}m_w+a_{ss}m_s,\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{3.19}\\]\nwith:\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\gamma                  &= -(k_f + w),\\\\\na_{ww}                  &= - (k_w + d_ w +s)\\\\\na_{ws}                  &= d_s\\\\\na_{sw}                  &= d_w+s\\\\\na_{ss}                  &= -(k_s+d_s)\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{3.20}\\]\nwhere the various physico-chemical parameters are assumed to be constant during a daily time-step (see Sec. TODO for the actual numerical values).\nThe evolution of \\(m_f\\) is easily obtained:\n\\[\nm_f(t) = e^{\\gamma t}m_f(0).\n\\tag{3.21}\\]\nPlugging this into the three-dimensional system 3.19 we obtain a reduced two-dimensional system for the water-sediment compartments:\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\dfrac{\\text d{m}_w}{\\text d t} & = a_{ww} m_w+a_{ws}m_s + w e ^{\\gamma t}m_f(0), \\\\\n\\dfrac{\\text d{m}_s}{\\text d t} & = a_{sw}m_w+a_{ss}m_s,\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{3.22}\\]\nwhich is solved explicitly with standard methods7.\n\n\n3.5.3.2 Step 2. Mass losses due to outflow\nMass losses due to outflow are computed as if the outflow process happened instantaneously after the processes discussed in the previous step took place. The amount of mass in the water compartment is affected as follows:\n\\[\nm_w \\to \\frac{V_f}{V_i} m_w,\n\\tag{3.23}\\]\nwhere \\(V_i\\) and \\(V_f\\) denote the initial and final volume for the outflow process. We assume that \\(V_f\\) coincides with the value \\(V(t)\\) simulated by the HBP model component (cf. Sec TODO), so that \\(V_i = V(t) + O(t)\\), where \\(O(t)\\) denotes the total simulated outflow for day \\(t\\).\n\n\n3.5.3.3 Step 3. Chemical Applications\nApplications are computed as instantaneous and subsequent to outflow. Masses in the various compartments (\\(i = f,\\,w,\\,s\\)) are modified as follows:\n\\[\nm_i \\to m_i + a_i\n\\tag{3.24}\\]\n\n\n3.5.3.4 Step 4. Solubility\nThe chemical density in the water compartment after Steps 1, 2, and 3 is eventually compared with the chemical’s solubility \\(\\rho\\), and any mass excess is instantaneously transferred to the sediment compartment. This implies the following modifications:\n\\[\nm_s \\to m_s + \\max(0, \\,m_w - \\rho V),\\quad m_w\\to\\max(m_w,\\,\\rho V),\n\\tag{3.25}\\]\nwhere, for the volume \\(V\\) we again use the value \\(V(t)\\) simulated by the HBP model component.",
