    "text": "1.1 Acknowledgements\nMediterranean coastal wetlands are exposed to multiple anthropogenic pressures, one of the most significant being pollution from intensive rice production. Among the most critical pollutants associated with rice cultivation are synthetic pesticides, particularly herbicides, insecticides, and fungicides. Once applied in rice production, pesticides can be transported through spray-drift, surface runoff or leaching into nearby water bodies, threatening the structure and functioning of aquatic ecosystems.\nThe ERAHUMED Decision Support System (DSS) was designed to evaluate the exposure and risks of pesticides used in rice cultivation, focusing on the Albufera Natural Park as a reference and study wetland. The Albufera Natural Park, located near Valencia, Spain, is one of the most important wetlands in the Mediterranean region. It spans an area of 21 hectares, including the Albufera lagoon, surrounding marshlands, rice fields, and sand dunes. The freshwater lagoon is connected to the Mediterranean Sea through a system of canals known as “golas.” The park is a Ramsar site and hosts a wide variety of flora and fauna, including several endemic and endangered species.\nThe DSS dynamically calculates the volume of water available in rice fields, canals, and the lagoon throughout the year. Additionally, it can dynamically predict pesticide concentrations in various environmental matrices, including rice crops, surface water, and sediment. Finally, the DSS evaluates the risks associated with each pesticide and their mixtures for aquatic ecosystems, based on Species Sensitivity Distributions (SSDs).\nThe DSS can be used to predict exposure and risks associated with different pesticides, considering their unique physico-chemical and toxicological properties, at a landscape level. It determines spatially explicit and dynamic variations in concentrations within each water body over time. This makes it a valuable tool for decision-making regarding rice cultivation management and implementing risk mitigation measures at an ecosystem-wide scale. Furthermore, it allows for prospective ecological risk assessments of new substances and the identification of pollution hot-spots and the combined effects of complex contaminant mixtures.\nOn the practical side, the DSS is implemented as an R package called {erahumed}, distributed as open-source software and available for download here. The package includes a Graphical User Interface (GUI), implemented as a Shiny application, which allows users to run the models and analyze the results without directly interacting with the underlying R code.\nThis documentation provides a comprehensive description of the ERAHUMED Decision Support System (DSS), covering both its scientific foundations and practical use. The main chapters detail the core components of the model—starting with an overview and followed by in-depth descriptions of input parameters, hydrology, pesticide exposure, and ecological risk assessment. These are complemented by two concluding chapters that briefly describe how to operate the system through the R package or the graphical user interface. These final chapters are intentionally concise, as a complete and up-to-date user manual is already available on the package website at https://erahumed.github.io/erahumed/, which may be sufficient for many practical purposes.\nThe ERAHUMED DSS has been financed by the Talented Researcher Support Programme - PlanGenT (CIDEGENT/2020/043) of the Generalitat Valenciana.",

    "text": "2.1 Structure of ecological risk simulations\nBefore diving into the technical details of the ERAHUMED Decision Support System, this chapter provides a high-level overview of its core structure and modeling approach. The goal is to offer readers an intuitive understanding of what ERAHUMED does—how it conceptualizes the landscape of the Albufera Natural Park, simulates water and chemical dynamics, and evaluates ecological risks—before introducing the formal models and data inputs that underpin each component.\nWe outline the main building blocks of the simulation workflow, the hydrogeographical simplifications that allow for efficient modeling of the park’s complex water system, and the customization capabilities available to simulate diverse agrochemical management scenarios. Together, these elements form the foundation upon which the more detailed descriptions in the following chapters will build.\nThe ERAHUMED model for assessing the ecological status of the Albufera Natural Park consists of three key components:\nFrom a spatial perspective, the natural park is divided into three types of water bodies: the Albufera lake, rice field clusters, and irrigation ditches, which hydrologically connect the lake to the fields. Each of the model’s computational layers incorporates specific quantitative models to simulate the relevant processes across all water bodies. This is summarized in Figure 2.1, where arrows indicate downstream dependencies and define the logical computation order.\nTo clarify this structure, we can summarize the role of each simulation layer in Figure 2.1 as follows:",

This is achieved through a set of simplifying assumptions about the hydrology of rice fields and irrigation ditches. Details on this model are provided in Chapter 5.\nExposure to chemicals is calculated by first simulating their application to rice fields based on typical cultivation patterns. The dispersion of chemicals is then modeled using a set of differential equations designed to capture the key physical processes driving their spread. These calculations are described in detail in Chapter 6.\nThe impact of chemicals across all water bodies is assessed using model-based approaches, currently including Species Sensitivity Distributions (SSDs) and Risk Quotients (RQs). These approaches rely on publicly available toxicity data to estimate ecological risk. Full details of the risk assessment methodology are provided in Chapter 7.",

    "section": "2.2 Hydrogeographical representation",
    "text": "2.2 Hydrogeographical representation\nThe ERAHUMED model implements a spatially explicit representation of the Albufera Natural Park to support ecological risk assessment of pesticide use. This representation captures the hydrological and geographical structure of the park through a simplified model that focuses on the dominant water flow pathways and landscape units relevant to exposure and risk modeling.\nAt the core of this model are three hydro-geographical components:\n\nRice field clusters, representing the agricultural units where pesticide applications occur.\nDitches, which act as conduits for water (and associated pesticide loads) draining from the fields.\nThe Albufera lake, which serves as the terminal water body receiving inputs from the surrounding landscape.\n\nThe actual geographical identification of clusters and ditches was provided in Martı́nez-Megı́as et al. (2024), to which we refer the reader for further details. This resulted in 552 rice field clusters, distributed across the irrigation sub-basins identified by 26 ditches, that are shown below in an interactive map.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe schematic diagram shown in Figure 2.2 illustrates the simplified conceptual model of the Albufera Natural Park used in ERAHUMED. The model accounts for water flows across three primary landscape elements: rice clusters, ditches, and the Albufera lake, as depicted by the directional arrows. Key simplifying assumptions embedded in the model and visually summarized in the diagram are as follows:\n\nRice field clusters Clusters are irrigated by external water sources and drain exclusively into the ditches. There is no direct hydrological interaction or exchange between individual clusters.\nDitches Ditches collect water from the clusters and, potentially, from additional external sources. They channel all inflows directly into the Albufera lake.\nThe Albufera Lake The lake receives water exclusively from the ditches. While two types of outflow are considered, namely direct discharge to the sea and water recirculation to the rice fields, the latter is typically negligible1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: Schematic representation of the ERAHUMED hydrogeographical model flow.",

    "text": "4.1 Chemicals\nWe begin our detailed description of the models implemented in the ERAHUMED Decision Support System by introducing how rice field management systems (RFMSs) are represented and configured. This is a natural starting point, as RFMSs define the agricultural and chemical practices that shape the simulation scenarios. They determine when and how water is managed in the fields, and which pesticides are applied, forming the basis upon which hydrological flows, chemical exposure, and ecological risks are computed.\nIn ERAHUMED, RFMSs serve as scenario-defining units that encapsulate the temporal patterns of agricultural operations for rice cultivation. These include:\nFrom this information, the system infers the irrigation and drainage patterns for each rice field cluster throughout the simulation period.\nIn the following sections, we describe the components that make up a complete rice field management system. We begin with the definition of chemicals, detailing the key physico-chemical and toxicological properties used to characterize each substance. We then explain how RFMSs are constructed by specifying crop calendar dates and scheduling chemical applications. In this part, particular attention is given to how the irrigation and drainage schedules are automatically derived from the crop cycle and the Perellonà period. Finally, we describe how RFMSs are spatially assigned to rice field clusters.\nEach rice field management system (RFMS) in ERAHUMED schedules applications of one or more chemical substances, typically pesticides. To simulate their transport, transformation, and ecological effects, each chemical must be defined as a structured object with a set of physicochemical, environmental, and toxicological properties.\nA chemical is characterized by the following groups of parameters (cf.

    "text": "4.2 Rice Field Management Systems\nA Rice Field Management System (RFMS) defines the temporal structure of agricultural practices relevant to pesticide exposure and water management in ERAHUMED. Each RFMS serves as a reusable template that can be assigned to one or more rice field clusters in the simulation landscape.\nAn RFMS is defined by two main components (cf. Table 3.3 and Table 3.4):\n\nCrop calendar The sowing and harvesting dates, and the start and end of the Perellonà period (a traditional post-harvest flooding phase specific to the region), and the respective target water levels in rice field clusters.\nChemical applications A schedule of pesticide applications, specifying the chemical, dose, and day of application relative to the crop calendar.\n\nFrom this minimal definition, ERAHUMED automatically derives the water management schedule for each rice field cluster. This includes the timing and magnitude of irrigation and drainage events throughout the year, based on a set of simple rules:\nDuring the sowing season, the field is maintained at a constant target water level (corresponding to the flow_height_cm of Table 3.3), except for periods in which ground pesticide applications require temporary draining. These draining periods are computed from the applications’ timing (seed_day of Table 3.4) and declared emptying duration (emptying_days). For ground applications requiring more than one emptying day, it is assumed that the actual pesticide application occurs on the last day of the emptying window, following a period of one or more drained days.\nDuring the Perellonà, the field is flooded to a higher water level (perellona_height_cm), simulating the traditional post-harvest flooding practice. This flooding is only applied if the cluster is marked as a tancat.\nOutside both the sowing season and the Perellonà, the field is assumed to be dry (i.e., water level is zero), regardless of the cluster type.\nBased on the resulting daily water level schedule, two boolean variables are derived:\n\nideal_irrigation: TRUE on days when the water level increases or remains constant while being above zero. These days are interpreted by the model as requiring active irrigation to maintain or restore the target level.\nideal_draining: TRUE on days when the water level decreases, or when it remains constant at a nonzero value, indicating a draining phase.\n\nThese irrigation and draining flags are passed to the hydrological simulation algorithms, where they determine water exchange rates between rice fields and the surrounding water bodies, and thus influence pesticide transport, dilution, and accumulation.",

This is done using a cluster map, which associates each cluster with a specific RFMS and determines whether Perellonà flooding is active.\nThe assignment process supports both uniform and heterogeneous scenarios. A cluster map is typically initialized by assigning a default RFMS to all clusters. Additional systems can then be allocated to specific subsets of clusters to reflect more complex landscape configurations.\nAllocations are based on spatial and structural filtering criteria:\n\nDitch: clusters are grouped by their associated ditch, allowing allocations to target specific hydrological subunits.\nField type: clusters are classified as regular or tancat (fields that undergo Perellonà flooding).\n\nTo allocate a new RFMS, a fraction of the surface area within the selected subset (defined by ditch and field type) is randomly assigned to the new system. Clusters are sampled without replacement until the requested surface area is reached, or until all eligible clusters are exhausted — in which case a partial allocation is performed.",

On the other hand, clusters are assumed to be irrigated from sources external the Albufera system, i.e., not through any of the ditches that eventually flow into the lake. According to our assumptions on the hydrology of clusters and ditches (cf. Section 2.2), the sum of cluster outflows is constrained by:\n\\[ \\sum _{c = 1} ^ {N_C} O_{c,t} \\leq Q_t  \\tag{5.7}\\]\nwhere \\(Q_t\\) denotes the inflow to the relevant ditch. With a small leap in logic, we anticipate from Section 5.4, that the water levels in irrigation ditches are assumed to be constant, so that \\(Q_t\\) can also be identified with the ditch outflow, that is in turn estimated as:\n\\[ Q_t = \\frac{\\text{Area of clusters draining into ditch}}{\\text{Area of all clusters}} \\times \\text{Lake's Inflow}_t  \\tag{5.8}\\]\nwhere the lake’s inflow is computed as described in Section 5.2.\nQualitatively speaking, the simulation determines daily values of \\(I_{c,t}\\) and \\(O_{c,t}\\) that satisfy Eqs. 5.6 and 5.7, and such that the resulting hydrology aligns as closely as possible with the “ideal” conditions prescribed by the specified management plan. This is accomplished in three steps:\n\nComputing ideal inflows and outflows based on current water levels and management plans.\nDetermining actual inflows and outflows, along with the corresponding actual water level changes.\nAdjusting management plan delays if some clusters were scheduled to be drained but could not be due to insufficient flow through the common ditch (see below for details).\n\nThese steps are iterated on a daily basis, starting from some initial time (say \\(t = 0\\)) at which all cluster water levels match the ideal ones, and no plan delays are present.\nConcerning the last step, a few words may serve to clarify the algorithm described below. The purpose of management plan delays is to ensure that during each year’s sowing season, all cluster’s are eventually emptied as required for ground applications of chemicals (modeled in subsequent layers of the simulation). This is achieved by postponing the management plan by one day whenever an emptying condition is not met. Outside of the sowing window, delays are reset to zero to prevent them from accumulating indefinitely, which would be unrealistic.\nIn what follows, the conversion between cluster water volumes and depths is provided by \\(V_{c,t} = A_c \\cdot h_{c,t}\\), and we denote by \\(\\delta_{c,t}\\) the time series of plan delays for cluster \\(c\\), which is initialized by \\(\\delta_{c,0} =0\\).\n\n5.3.1 Step 1: ideal balance\nIdeal balance quantities for each cluster \\(c\\) are obtained from the ideal water management variables \\(\\text{Ir}_{d,c}\\), \\(\\text{Dr}_{d,c}\\) and \\(\\mathcal H _{d,c}\\), by matching the day of year \\(d\\) with the delayed day:\n\\[\nd_{c,t+1} = d_{t+1}-\\delta_{c,t},\n\\tag{5.9}\\]\nwhere \\(d_{t+1}\\) denotes the day of year corresponding to time \\(t+1\\), and \\(\\delta_{c,t}\\) the accumulated plan delay.\nLet \\(h _{c,t+1}^{\\text{id}}\\) denote the ideal depth for cluster \\(c\\) at time \\(t+1\\) retrieved in this way, and \\(\\text{Ir}_{c,t}\\), \\(\\text{Dr}_{c,t}\\) the corresponding irrigation and draining plans. Furthermore, denote by \\(V_{c,t+1}^{\\text{id}} = A_c \\cdot h_{c,t+1}^{\\text{id}}\\) the corresponding ideal water volume.\nIn order to compute ideal inflow and outflow, we require (cf. Equation 5.6):\n\\[\nV_{c,t+1}^{\\text{id}} = \\max \\lbrace V_{c,t}^{\\text{id}}  + (\\text{P}_t-\\text{ETP}_t)\\times A_c,0 \\rbrace + I_{c,t}^{\\text{id}}-O_{c,t}^{\\text{id}}\n\\tag{5.10}\\]\nClearly, Equation 5.10 alone does not individually specify \\(I_{c,t}^{\\text{id}}\\) and \\(O_{c,t}^{\\text{id}}\\), but only their difference \\(\\Delta _{c,t}^{\\text{id}}= I_{c,t}^{\\text{id}}-O_{c,t}^{\\text{id}}\\). In order to fix both these quantities:\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\n(I_{c,t} ^\\text{id})^{(0)}&= \\begin{cases}\n  k_\\text{flow}  & \\text{if }\\text{Ir}_{c,t} = \\text{Dr}_{c,t} = 1 \\\\\n  0 & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases},\\\\\n(O_{c,t} ^\\text{id})^{(0)}&=(I_{c,t} ^\\text{id})^{(0)}-\\Delta _{c,t}^{\\text{id}}.\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{5.11}\\]\nand, in order to ensure that flows are positive, we finally set:\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\nO_{c,t} ^\\text{id} &= \\max\\lbrace(O_{c,t} ^\\text{id})^{(0)},\\,0\\rbrace\\\\\nI_{c,t} ^\\text{id} &= O_{c,t} ^\\text{id} + \\Delta _{c,t}^{\\text{id}},\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{5.12}\\]\nwhich satisfy Equation 5.10 and give rise to positive \\(O_{c,t}^\\text{id}\\) and \\(I_{c,t}^\\text{id}\\).\n\n\n5.3.2 Step 2: real balance\nAt each time-step \\(t\\), the cluster’s index set is randomly permuted 1, and the real flows are calculated as:\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\nO_{c,t} &= \\min \\lbrace O_{c,t}^\\text{id},\\,Q_t-\\sum_{c'&lt;c}O_{c',t} \\rbrace ,\\\\\nI_{c,t} &= \\max\\lbrace I_{c,t}^\\text{id}-O_{c,t}^\\text{id} + O_{c,t},\\,0 \\rbrace\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{5.13}\\]\nIn simple terms, clusters are emptied in a random order within the allowed capacity of the corresponding ditch. Using Equation 5.13, we finally determine the real water level achieved as:\n\\[\nV_{c,t+1} = \\max \\lbrace V_{c,t}  + (\\text{P}_t-\\text{ETP}_t)\\times A_c,0 \\rbrace + I_{c,t}-O_{c,t}\n\\tag{5.14}\\]\nto be compared with Equation 5.10.\n\n\n5.3.3 Step 3: updating the plan delay\nThe updated value \\(\\delta _{c,t+1}\\) is obtained as follows.

    "text": "6.1 Diagram of physical processes\nThis Chapter describes how ERAHUMED models pesticide exposure in the Albufera Natural Park. The hydrological simulation discussed in the previous Chapter provides the foundation for this analysis, as water serves as the primary medium for pesticide transport. Here, we outline how ERAHUMED simulates the introduction, dispersion, and fate of pesticides within the system. This includes processes such as deposition, degradation, and transfer between water bodies. By integrating hydrological dynamics with chemical behavior, the model estimates exposure levels over time and space.\nAs illustrated in our hydrological model (Figure 2.2), pesticides applied to rice field clusters are transported through water flow into ditches, then into the Albufera lake, and ultimately to the sea.\nFrom a mathematical perspective, the fate of chemicals in each water body—clusters, ditches, and the lake—is governed by the same system of differential equations. These equations represent key physico-chemical processes, including advective transport, diffusive exchange between compartments, and degradation. However, pesticide applications occur exclusively in clusters; concentrations in ditches and the lake arise solely from upstream inflows.\nThe remainder of this chapter describes our approach to pesticide dispersion. We define the simplified differential system used to model these processes in Section 6.2, and we present our semi-analytic solution method in Section 6.3. Section 6.4 finally describes how the parameters of the differential system are derived from the basic input parameters listed in Chapter 3.\nThe schematic diagram below illustrates the processes captured by our model for chemical dispersion. Directional arrows represent the transfer of chemical matter among the three compartments considered—Foliage, Water, and Soil—as well as exchanges with external water bodies (denoted as “Watercourse”).\nWhile the overall scheme applies to all landscape elements, specific details vary for clusters, ditches, and the lake (cf. the hydrological model of Figure 2.2):",

We denote its masses in the three compartments—foliage1, water, and sediment—by \\(m_f\\), \\(m_w\\), and \\(m_s\\), respectively. We assume that, at any given time, these masses are fully diluted and homogeneously distributed. In particular, we can meaningfully define spatially constant concentrations \\(c_f\\) and \\(c_s\\) in the water2 and sediment compartments.\nWe provide below the differential system that drives the temporal dynamics of \\(m_f\\), \\(m_w\\) and \\(m_s\\). The correspondence between the parameters used in this Section and the ERAHUMED model inputs is provided later (Section 6.4).\nThe fundamental equations describing pesticide diffusion are given as follows:\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\dfrac{\\text d{m}_f}{\\text d t} & = -(k_f+w)m_f+a_f\\\\\n\\dfrac{\\text d{m}_w}{\\text d t} & = -(k_w+d_w+s+\\frac{O}{V})m_w+d_sm_s+wm_f+a_w-\\sigma(\\frac{m_w}{\\rho V}) \\\\\n\\dfrac{\\text d{m}_s}{\\text d t} & = (d_w+s)m_w-(k_s+d_s)m_s+a_s+\\sigma(\\frac{m_w}{\\rho V})\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{6.1}\\]\nwhere:\n\n\\(a_{f,w,s}\\) are the mass income rates of the chemical in the three compartments, that include direct pesticide application and mass coming from inflows.\n\\(k_{f,w,s}\\) are the degradation rates of the chemical in the three compartments,\n\\(d_w\\) and \\(d_s\\) are the water-sediment diffusion rates,\n\\(s\\) is the settling rate,\n\\(w\\) is the washout rate,\n\\(O\\) is the outflow rate of the rice field,\n\\(V\\) is the volume of water in the rice field,\n\\(\\rho\\) is the chemical solubility in water,\n\\(\\sigma(x)\\) is a function (not further specified, see below) that grows quickly for \\(x &gt; 1\\), and vanishes for \\(x \\leq 1\\). This function accounts for solubility.\n\nStrictly speaking, all these terms have instantaneous time dependence3. Apart from making the system 6.1 hard to attack by analytic means, such a dependence is troubling because we don’t have access to the exact time dependence of the majority of these terms (e.g. outflow, volume or chemical applications), our input consisting of simple daily average/cumulative values. On the other hand, if all the terms were constant, and if we could neglect \\(\\sigma\\), the solution of Equation 6.1 would be immediate, as the corresponding system becomes a linear ODE with constant coefficients, in addition whose eigenvalues and eigenvectors can be computed explicitly.\nWhat we use in practice is an intermediate semi-analytic approach that allows us to compute daily values of \\(m_{f,w,s}\\), which is described next.",

As to the second term, the amount of incoming mass is exactly given by the amount of outgoing mass in the outflow of the preceding element along the water course chain, which is computed as detailed in the previous Section.\n\n\n6.3.4 Step 4: solubility\nThe chemical density in the water compartment after Steps 1, 2, and 3 is eventually compared with the chemical’s solubility \\(\\rho\\), and any mass excess is instantaneously transferred to the sediment compartment.

Accordingly, we can express the total mass input as:\n\\[\na_X = a_X ^{\\text{app}}+ a_X ^{\\text{inflow}} \\qquad (X = f,\\,s,\\,w).\n\\tag{6.9}\\]\nwhere \\(X\\) denotes the compartment receiving the input.\nThe inflow contribution is computed as:\n\\[\na_X ^{\\text{inflow}} = \\sum _{i} m_i ^{\\text {inflow}},\n\\tag{6.10}\\]\nwhere the sum runs over the relevant inflow sources for the water body under consideration. Inflow masses \\(m_i ^{\\text {inflow}}\\) Equation 6.6 are obtained from Equation 6.6 when the source is a hydrological element higher in the flow network (e.g., clusters for ditches, or ditches for the lake). At the current stage of development, external sources are assumed to have zero pesticide concentration and are thus excluded from the mass inflow calculation.\nApplication rates are given by:\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\na_f^{\\text{app}} &= A(t)\\cdot \\phi(t),\\\\\na_s^{\\text{app}} &= A(t)(1-\\phi(t))I(h(t+1)=0),\\\\\na_w^{\\text{app}} &= A(t)\\cdot (1-\\phi(t))I(h(t+1)\\neq0),\\\\\n\\end{split}\n\\]\nHere, \\(A(t)\\) is the applied amount on day \\(t\\), whose computation is described below; \\(I(h(t+1)=0)\\) is equal to one if the water level of the cluster \\(h(t+1) =0\\), and vanishes otherwise5; the quantities \\(\\text{drift}\\), \\(\\text{SNK}\\) correspond to the internal drift and SNK parameters (cf. Chapter 3); finally \\(c\\) is the coverage fraction, computed as:\n\\[\n\\phi(t) = \\min\\left[\\frac{d_s(t)}{j_{\\text{grow}}},\\,1\\right]\\cdot \\phi_{\\text{max}},\n\\] where \\(d_s(t)\\) is the number of days elapsed from seeding, while \\(j_\\text{grow}\\) and \\(\\phi_\\text{max}\\) correspond to the input parameters jgrow and covmax.\nThe actual day on which a pesticide application takes place is determined by adjusting the nominal application day specified in the RFMS definition (see Section 4.2) using the plan delay computed in the hydrological simulation (see Section 5.3). Concretely, if we denote by \\(\\mathcal D\\) the nominal day of year for pesticide application, by \\(d_{t}\\) the day of year corresponding to a given date \\(t\\), and by \\(\\delta _{c,t}\\) the plan delay for a cluster \\(c\\) on the same date (cf. Equation 5.9), the actual application date6 is given by:\n\\[ T_{\\text{application}} =\\max\\lbrace t \\,\\vert\\, d_{t}-\\delta_{c,t} = \\mathcal D\\rbrace   \\tag{6.11}\\]\nThe amount of active ingredient applied is defined by the corresponding dose parameter in the input specification (cf. Table 3.4).\n\n\n6.4.2 Degradation rates\nDaily degradation rates \\(k_{f,w,s}(t)\\) for the chemical are modeled through the Arrhenius equation, schematically:\n\\[\nk(t) = k_0 \\cdot Q_{10}^{\\frac{T(t)-T_0}{10}}\n\\] where \\(k_0\\) is the degradation rate \\(k_0\\) at a reference temperature \\(T_0\\), \\(Q_{10}\\) is a numerical constant, and \\(T(t)\\) is the average temperature on day \\(t\\). All these numerical quantities are chemical input parameters (see Table 3.2), except for the daily temperature \\(T(t)\\), that comes from observational data (column temperature_ave of weather_df, see Section 3.1.1.1 for reference).\nFor the sediment compartment, we compute two degradation constants \\(k_s^{\\text{sat/unsat}}\\), for saturated and unsaturated sediment, respectively (the input parameters for the calculation of these two constants are independent, see Table 3.2). The degradation rate in the solid compartment at time \\(t\\) is eventually given by:\n\\[\nk_s(t) = k_s ^{\\text{sat}}(t) I(h(t)\\neq0)+k_s ^{\\text{unsat}}(t) I(h(t)=0)\n\\tag{6.12}\\]\n\n\n6.4.3 Diffusion rates\nDiffusion rates are given by:\n\\[\nd_w(t) = \\frac{k_\\text{dif}\\cdot f_{D,w}}{h(t)}, \\quad d_s = \\frac{k_\\text{dif}\\cdot f_{D,s}}{h_{\\text{act}}\\cdot \\text{pos}}\n\\] where \\(h(t)\\) is the water depth of the hydrological element; \\(h_\\text{act}\\) is the depth of active sediment, corresponding to the simulation parameter dact_m; \\(\\text{pos}\\) corresponds to the porosity simulation parameter; \\(k_\\text{dif}\\) is given by the empirical formula:\n\\[\nk_\\text{dif} = \\left( \\frac{69.35}{365} - \\text{pos}\\cdot M^{-2/3} \\right)\\frac{\\text{m}}{\\text{day}}\n\\]\nwhere \\(M\\) is the molecular weight of the chemical (chemical parameter MW); finally, \\(f_{D,w}\\) and \\(f_{D,s}\\) are given by:\n\\[\nf_{D,w} = \\frac{1}{1+c^{\\text{ss}}\\cdot k_d^{\\text{ss}} } \\qquad f_{D,s} = \\frac{\\text{pos}}{\\text{pos}+b_d\\cdot k_d^{\\text{sed}} } \\qquad\n\\]\nwhere \\(c^{\\text{ss}}\\) and \\(b_d\\) correspond to the input parameters css_ppm and bd_g_cm3, while \\(k_d^{\\text{sed/ss}}\\) are the partition sediment and suspended solid water partition coefficients, computed as:\n\\[\nk_d ^{\\text{sed/ss}} = \\text{foc}^{\\text{sed/ss}}\\cdot k_\\text{oc}\n\\] where \\(\\text{foc}^{\\text{sed/ss}}\\) correspond to the environmental parameters foc_ss and foc_sed, respectively, and \\(k_\\text{oc}\\) is the chemical parameter koc_cm3_g.\n\n\n6.4.4 Settling rate\nThe daily settling rate is computed as:\n\\[\ns(t) = \\dfrac{k_{\\text{setl}}(1-f_{D,w})}{h(t)}\n\\] where \\(k_{\\text{setl}}\\) corresponds to the chemical parameter k_setl_m_day.\n\n\n6.4.5 Washout rate\nThe daily washout rate is computed as:\n\\[\nw(t) = \\text{fet} \\cdot P(t)\n\\] where \\(P(t)\\) is the daily precipitation per unit area, while \\(\\text{fet}\\) is the chemical parameter fet_cm.\n\n\n6.4.6 Solubility\nThe solubility \\(\\rho\\) of chemicals correspond to the solubility input parameter.",

    "text": "This chapter describes how ERAHUMED assesses the toxicological risks associated with pesticide exposure in the Albufera Natural Park. Building on the hydrological and exposure simulations described in previous chapters, the risk assessment module estimates potential impacts on aquatic organisms and the broader ecosystem.\nERAHUMED adopts the Species Sensitivity Distribution (SSD) methodology—a widely used approach in ecological risk assessment (Posthuma, Suter II, and Traas 2002). This method enables the quantification of the Potentially Affected Fraction (PAF) of species at a given chemical concentration, offering a probabilistic estimate of ecosystem-level effects. By linking simulated concentrations to biological sensitivity, this layer identifies high-risk scenarios and supports decision-making aimed at mitigating adverse outcomes.\nAs ERAHUMED applies predefined SSD parameters rather than computing them from toxicity data, the present chapter focuses on their application to simulation results. For details on the derivation and validation of SSDs, we refer the reader to (Amador Crespo et al. 2024).\nThe risk estimation approach follows the methodology described in (Amador Crespo et al. 2024), to which we refer the reader for a detailed exposition. Here, we summarize the elements that are directly relevant to ERAHUMED’s implementation.\nSSDs are used to translate the pesticide concentrations computed in the Exposure module (Chapter 6) into daily values of PAF. Chemicals are grouped according to their TMoA classification (encoded by the tmoa_id chemical parameter, cf. Table 3.2), and the effects of different TMoAs are assumed to be independent.\nTwo distinct SSDs are provided for each chemical:\n\nAcute risk is evaluated using daily concentrations.\nChronic risk is evaluated using a 21-day rolling average of concentrations, reflecting longer-term exposure effects.\n\nThe SSDs are assumed to follow a log-normal distribution and are thus parametrized in terms of their mean and standard deviations (ssd_acute_mu/sigma and ssd_chronic_mu/sigma parameters in Table 3.2).\nRisk estimates are computed both at the level of individual chemicals and at the level of their associated TMoA. This dual perspective enables the identification of both compound-specific risks and mode-of-action-level cumulative effects. To obtain the overall risk, ERAHUMED combines the risks associated with each TMoA under the assumption of statistical independence, following the approach described in (Amador Crespo et al. 2024). Specifically, the overall PAF is computed as:\n\\[\n\\text{msPAF} = 1 - \\prod _i (1-\\text{PAF}_i)\n\\tag{7.1}\\]\nwhere \\(\\text{PAF}_i\\) is the risk associated with TMoA \\(i\\).\nIn addition to PAFs, ERAHUMED also computes Risk Quotients (RQs) by comparing simulated concentrations to the 5th percentile of the SSD (HC05), using the conventional ratio:\n\\[\n\\text{RQ} = \\frac{\\text{Concentration}}{\\text{HC05}}\n\\tag{7.2}\\]\nAlthough the HC05 is derived from the same SSDs used for PAF calculation, the Risk Quotient (RQ) itself does not have a probabilistic interpretation. Instead, it serves as a simple descriptive indicator of potential concern, offering an alternative, threshold-based perspective on risk, complementary to the PAF.\n\n\n\n\nAmador Crespo, Pablo, Juan M.

The GUI provides an intuitive way to configure all model inputs described in Chapter 3 and includes predefined visualizations for main model outputs. This makes it an efficient tool for exploring the ecosystem’s behavior and analyzing its sensitivity to different scenarios. Additionally, users can export output data for further analysis outside the Decision Support System (DSS).\nThe GUI is part of a broader software package—an R library—which we describe in detail in Chapter 9. If the interface described in this chapter differs from the one you see, please note that this manual refers to version 0.20.1 of the ERAHUMED software. You can check your version number in the top-left corner of the GUI to ensure you are working with the same release.\nAt the present moment, the GUI can only be run from R, through the package {erahumed}, which is publicly available on Github. Details on R and on the {erahumed} package are provided in Chapter 9 and references therein (see, in particular, Sections 9.1 and 9.2 for instructions on how to install R and the {erahumed} package).

    "text": "8.2 Interface Overview and Basic Workflow\nOnce launched, the ERAHUMED Decision Support System (DSS) opens in your web browser. The interface is organized into multiple tabs that guide the user through the process of defining a simulation scenario, running the model, and exploring the results.\nAt its core, the GUI follows a simple two-phase workflow:\n\nSet up the scenario:\nUse the input tabs to configure landscape parameters, chemical definitions, rice field management systems (RFMS), spatial allocation, and simulation settings. Each section mirrors the corresponding input groups described in Chapter 3, and most input fields are accompanied by labels and tooltips that make them self-explanatory.\nRun the simulation:\nWhen you are satisfied with your configuration, press the “Run” button located in the top right. The model will process your scenario and display outputs as interactive plots and summary tables.\n\nSimulation results can be exported in tabular format for post-processing or further analysis in R or other software environments, using the “Download results” button.",

    "text": "9.1 Installing R\nAs mentioned in Chapter 8, the software infrastructure of the ERAHUMED DSS is a library for the R programming language. The {erahumed} R package already has extensive documentation, which you can consult on its main website. In particular, this article provides a step-by-step guide to the package’s main functionalities, explaining how to run a simulation.\nThe rest of this chapter provides brief instructions on installing R and the {erahumed} package. If you are a proficient R user, you may confidently skip this part and simply follow the instructions in the package README to install {erahumed} and launch the Shiny app that provides its GUI.\nThe {erahumed} R package is open-source software and is hosted on GitHub. If you have a suggestion, want to report a bug, or need help, feel free to open a GitHub issue (you will need to sign in to GitHub with a personal account, which you can create for free). Pull requests with code improvements are also welcome!\nR is a free programming language and software environment widely adopted in the scientific community due to its powerful statistical capabilities and user-friendly interface. The {erahumed} package allows users to run simulations, prepare custom inputs, and explore outputs in detail—all from the R command line. Compared to the graphical user interface (GUI), using R directly provides greater flexibility and control over these operations.\nTo install R, visit the official R project website, where you will find detailed installation instructions for various operating systems. If you are new to R, there are many introductory resources available online, including the official R manual from the R Core Team. However, if your only goal is to run the ERAHUMED GUI on your local machine, you won’t need extensive knowledge of R. Simply installing R and running a few commands in the command line will be enough to get started.",
