# The ERAHUMED DSS Graphical User Interface {#sec-erahumed-gui}

The easiest way to run a simulation with ERAHUMED is through its Graphical User 
Interface (GUI), which we describe in this chapter. The GUI provides an 
intuitive way to configure all model inputs described in @sec-model-inputs and 
includes predefined visualizations for main model outputs. This makes it an 
efficient tool for exploring the ecosystem's behavior and analyzing its 
sensitivity to different scenarios. Additionally, users can export output data 
for further analysis outside the Decision Support System (DSS).

The GUI is part of a broader software package—an R library—which we describe 
in detail in @sec-erahumed-pkg. If the screenshots in this chapter differ from 
the interface you see, check the version number (displayed within the GUI) to 
ensure you are working with the same release.

## How to run the GUI

At the present moment, the GUI can only be run from R, through the package
`{erahumed}`, which is publicly available on 
[Github](https://erahumed.github.io/erahumed/). Details on R and on the 
`{erahumed}` package are provided in @sec-erahumed-pkg and references therein 
(see, in particular, Sections [-@sec-installing-r] and 
[-@sec-installing-erahumed] for instructions on how to install R and the 
`{erahumed}` package). Once you have installed `{erahumed}`, you can access its
GUI by running in R the following command:

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| include: true
erahumed::launch_dss()
```

## The *Output* tab

Upon launching the GUI, you are greeted by the *Output* tab (@fig-output-tab), 
which serves as the main dashboard for viewing model results through interactive 
visualizations. Generating the plots may take around 10 to 20 seconds, 
corresponding to the time required to complete a full simulation for a one-year 
period.

The dashboard is divided into three sections, each corresponding to a model 
component: 

* **Hydrology** (@sec-hydrology): Displays water level variations and flow 
patterns over time.
* **Exposure** (@sec-exposure): Shows the concentration of different pesticides 
in water and sediment.
* **Risk** (@sec-risk): Assesses potential ecological impacts based on pesticide 
exposure.

Users can explore these components across different hydrological 
elements of the Albufera Natural Park, including the Albufera lake, irrigation 
ditches, and rice field clusters. The specific location can be selected using 
the "Water body" dropdown menu. The interactive plots allow users to zoom, pan, 
and filter data over specific time periods, facilitating a more detailed analysis of model outputs.

The "Download results" button, located in the top-right corner, exports all 
raw model outputs as a compressed `.zip` file containing `.csv` data.

The visualizations in this tab reflect the selected input parameters. Adjusting 
inputs in the Input tab described in the next Section allows users to explore 
different scenarios and assess their impact on model outcomes.
