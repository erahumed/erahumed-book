# Risk assessment {#sec-risk}

This Chapter describes how ERAHUMED assesses the toxicological risks associated 
with pesticide exposure in the Albufera Natural Park. Building on the 
hydrological and exposure models from the previous Chapters, this step estimates 
the potential impacts on aquatic organisms and the broader ecosystem. 
We employ the Species Sensitivity Distribution (SSD) approach, a widely used 
method in ecological risk assessment [TODO reference]. This approach allows for 
the identification of high-risk scenarios, supporting management decisions to 
mitigate adverse effects.

## Calculation of risk using SSDs

The risk calculation follows the approach outlined in [TODO A.Rico Reference], 
to which we refer the reader for further details. Here, we summarize the key 
aspects relevant to our model.

SSDs transform the chemical concentrations computed in the previous "Exposure" 
simulation layer (@sec-exposure) into the potentially affected fraction of 
species (PAF). As described in [TODO], chemicals are grouped by toxic mode of 
action (TMoA), and different TMoAs are assumed to act independently.

Separate distributions are used to assess acute and chronic risks. In the case 
of acute risk, we use daily chemical concentration values (computed as described 
in @sec-exposure). For chronic risk, we use a 21-day rolling average of 
concentrations.

The parameters of each SSD, as well as the TMoA classification for each 
chemical, are internal to ERAHUMED and are not directly accessible to the user.
