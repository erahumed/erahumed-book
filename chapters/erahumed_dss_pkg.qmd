# The `{erahumed}` R package {#sec-erahumed-pkg}

As mentioned in @sec-erahumed-gui, the software infrastructure of the ERAHUMED DSS is a library for the R programming language. The `{erahumed}` R package already has extensive documentation, which you can consult on its [main website](https://erahumed.github.io/erahumed/). In particular, [this article](https://erahumed.github.io/erahumed/articles/erahumed-workflow.html) provides a step-by-step guide to the package’s main functionalities, explaining how to run a simulation.

The rest of this chapter provides brief instructions on installing R and the `{erahumed}` package. If you are a proficient R user, you may confidently skip this part and simply follow the instructions in the [package README](https://erahumed.github.io/erahumed/) to install `{erahumed}` and launch the Shiny app that provides its GUI.

The `{erahumed}` R package is open-source software and is hosted [on GitHub](https://github.com/erahumed/erahumed/). If you have a suggestion, want to report a bug, or need help, feel free to open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/erahumed/erahumed/issues) (you will need to sign in to GitHub with a personal account, which you can create for free). Pull requests with code improvements are also welcome!

## Installing R {#sec-installing-r}

R is a free programming language and software environment widely adopted in the scientific community due to its powerful statistical capabilities and user-friendly interface. The `{erahumed}` package allows users to run simulations, prepare custom inputs, and explore outputs in detail—all from the R command line. Compared to the graphical user interface (GUI), using R directly provides greater flexibility and control over these operations.

To install R, visit the [official R project website](https://www.r-project.org/), where you will find detailed installation instructions for various operating systems. If you are new to R, there are many introductory resources available online, including the [official R manual](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-intro.pdf) from the R Core Team. However, if your only goal is to run the ERAHUMED GUI on your local machine, you won’t need extensive knowledge of R. Simply installing R and running a few commands in the command line will be enough to get started.
