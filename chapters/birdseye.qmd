# The ERAHUMED model: a bird's eye view {#sec-birdseye}

This section should contain a brief overview of how the model is structured, 
introducing the three main model components (hydrology, exposure, risk) and 
hydrological elements (lake, ditches, clusters), as well as explaining how the
various components are interconnected with each other (*e.g.* the order of 
calculation).
