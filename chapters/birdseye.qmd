# The ERAHUMED model: a bird's eye view {#sec-birdseye}

The ERAHUMED model for assessing the ecological status of the Albufera Natural 
Park consists of three key components:

* **Hydrology**: Water dynamics within the park
* **Exposure**: Estimating the exposure to toxic chemicals
* **Risk Assessment**: Evaluating the impact of exposure

From a spatial perspective, the natural park is divided into three types of 
water bodies: the Albufera lake, rice field clusters[^clusters], and irrigation 
ditches, which hydrologically connect the lake to the fields. Each of the modelâ€™s 
computational layers incorporates specific quantitative models to simulate the 
relevant processes across all water bodies. This is summarized in @fig-layers, 
where arrows indicate downstream dependencies and define the logical computation 
order.

[^clusters]: The exact definition of "clusters" is discussed in 
@sec-hydrology-scheme. For the purposes of this high-level description, we can 
think of them simply as groups of rice fields.

To clarify this structure, we can summarize the role of each simulation layer in
@fig-layers as follows:

1. The system's hydrology, including water volumes and flows for all 
hydrological elements, is derived from minimal input data: daily water levels 
and sea outlet outflows for the Albufera lake. This is achieved 
through a set of simplifying assumptions about the hydrology of rice fields 
and irrigation ditches. Details on this model are provided in @sec-hydrology.

2. Exposure to chemicals is calculated by first simulating their application to 
rice fields based on typical cultivation patterns. The dispersion of chemicals 
is then modeled using a set of differential equations designed to 
capture the key physical processes driving their spread. These calculations are
described in detail @sec-exposure.

3. The impact of chemicals across all water bodies is assessed using 
model-based approaches, currently including Species Sensitivity Distributions 
(SSDs) and Risk Quotients (RQs). These approaches rely on publicly available 
toxicity data to estimate ecological risk. Full details of the risk assessment 
methodology are provided in @sec-risk.

In addition to the default simulation workflow, the ERAHUMED software includes 
advanced features that allow users to define custom chemical compounds and 
rice field management systems (RFMSs). While current agrochemical practices 
in the Albufera Natural Park are already built into the tool, these 
customization options greatly expand its capabilities. They enable the 
simulation and comparison of alternative scenarios, making the software a 
powerful resource for exploring potential changes in management or chemical use. 
Detailed guidance on how to define and allocate custom chemicals and RFMSs is 
provided in @sec-ui-chemicals and @sec-ui-rfms, respectively.

The next Section provides a detailed description of all model inputs, including 
hydrological data, chemical properties, and management practices, which underpin 
the simulation layers described above.
