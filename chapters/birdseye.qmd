# The ERAHUMED model: a bird's eye view {#sec-birdseye}

The ERAHUMED model for assessing the ecological status of the Albufera Natural 
Park consists of three key components:

* **Hydrology**: Water dynamics within the park
* **Exposure**: Estimating the exposure to toxic chemicals
* **Risk Assessment**: Evaluating the impact of exposure

From a spatial perspective, the natural park is divided into three types of 
water bodies: the Albufera lake, rice field clusters[^clusters], and irrigation 
ditches, which hydrologically connect the lake to the fields. Each of the modelâ€™s 
computational layers incorporates specific quantitative models to simulate the 
relevant processes across all water bodies. This is summarized in @fig-layers, 
where arrows indicate downstream dependencies and define the logical computation 
order.

[^clusters]: The exact definition of "clusters" is discussed in 
@sec-hydrology-scheme. For the purposes of this high-level description, we can 
think of them simply as groups of rice fields.

To clarify this structure, we can summarize the role of each simulation layer in
@fig-layers as follows:

1. The system's hydrology, including water volumes and flows for all 
hydrological elements, is derived from minimal input data: daily water levels 
and sea outlet outflows for the Albufera lake. This is achieved 
through a set of simplifying assumptions about the hydrology of rice fields 
and irrigation ditches. Details on this model are provided in @sec-hydrology.

2. Exposure to chemicals is calculated by first simulating their application to 
rice fields based on typical cultivation patterns. The dispersion of chemicals 
is then modeled using a simplified set of differential equations designed to 
capture the key physical processes driving their spread. These calculations are
described in detail @sec-exposure.

3. The impact of chemicals is evaluated across all water bodies using a 
simplified approach based on Species Sensitivity Distributions, utilizing 
publicly available toxicity data for their estimation. This is described in 
detail in @sec-risk.
