# Conceptual overview of the ERAHUMED model {#sec-birdseye}

Before diving into the technical details of the ERAHUMED Decision Support System, this chapter provides a high-level overview of its core structure and modeling approach. The goal is to offer readers an intuitive understanding of what ERAHUMED does—how it conceptualizes the landscape of the Albufera Natural Park, simulates water and chemical dynamics, and evaluates ecological risks—before introducing the formal models and data inputs that underpin each component.

We outline the main building blocks of the simulation workflow, the hydrogeographical simplifications that allow for efficient modeling of the park’s complex water system, and the customization capabilities available to simulate diverse agrochemical management scenarios. Together, these elements form the foundation upon which the more detailed descriptions in the following chapters will build.

## Structure of ecological risk simulations

The ERAHUMED model for assessing the ecological status of the Albufera Natural 
Park consists of three key components:

* **Hydrology**: Water dynamics within the park
* **Exposure**: Estimating the exposure to toxic chemicals
* **Risk Assessment**: Evaluating the impact of exposure

From a spatial perspective, the natural park is divided into three types of 
water bodies: the Albufera lake, rice field clusters, and irrigation 
ditches, which hydrologically connect the lake to the fields. Each of the model’s 
computational layers incorporates specific quantitative models to simulate the 
relevant processes across all water bodies. This is summarized in @fig-layers, 
where arrows indicate downstream dependencies and define the logical computation 
order.

To clarify this structure, we can summarize the role of each simulation layer in
@fig-layers as follows:

1. The system's hydrology, including water volumes and flows for all 
hydrological elements, is derived from minimal input data: daily water levels 
and sea outlet outflows for the Albufera lake. This is achieved 
through a set of simplifying assumptions about the hydrology of rice fields 
and irrigation ditches. Details on this model are provided in @sec-hydrology.

2. Exposure to chemicals is calculated by first simulating their application to 
rice fields based on typical cultivation patterns. The dispersion of chemicals 
is then modeled using a set of differential equations designed to 
capture the key physical processes driving their spread. These calculations are
described in detail in @sec-exposure.

3. The impact of chemicals across all water bodies is assessed using 
model-based approaches, currently including Species Sensitivity Distributions 
(SSDs) and Risk Quotients (RQs). These approaches rely on publicly available 
toxicity data to estimate ecological risk. Full details of the risk assessment 
methodology are provided in @sec-risk.

## Hydrogeographical representation

The ERAHUMED model implements a spatially explicit representation of the 
Albufera Natural Park to support ecological risk assessment of pesticide use. 
This representation captures the hydrological and geographical structure of the 
park through a simplified model that focuses on the dominant water flow 
pathways and landscape units relevant to exposure and risk modeling.

At the core of this model are three hydro-geographical components:

* **Rice field clusters**, representing the agricultural units where pesticide 
applications occur.

* **Ditches**, which act as conduits for water (and associated pesticide loads) 
draining from the fields.

* **The Albufera lake**, which serves as the terminal water body receiving 
inputs from the surrounding landscape.

The actual geographical identification of clusters and ditches was provided in @martinez2024pharmaceutical, to which we refer the reader for further details.
This resulted in 552 rice field clusters, distributed across the irrigation 
sub-basins identified by 26 ditches, that are shown below in an interactive map.

The schematic diagram shown in @fig-hydrology-scheme illustrates the simplified 
conceptual model of the Albufera Natural Park used in ERAHUMED. The model 
accounts for water flows across three primary landscape elements: rice 
clusters, ditches, and the Albufera lake, as depicted by the directional arrows. 
Key simplifying assumptions embedded in the model and visually summarized in the 
diagram are as follows:

* **Rice field clusters** Clusters are irrigated by external water sources and drain 
exclusively into the ditches. There is no direct hydrological interaction or 
exchange between individual clusters.

* **Ditches** Ditches collect water from the clusters and, potentially, from 
additional external sources. They channel all inflows directly into the Albufera 
lake.

* **The Albufera Lake**
The lake receives water exclusively from the ditches. While two types of outflow are considered, namely direct discharge to the sea and water recirculation to the rice fields, the latter is typically negligible^[Further details on this will be provided elsewhere.].

## Custom agrochemical schedules

Beyond the default simulation workflow, the ERAHUMED software provides advanced tools for defining custom chemical compounds and rice field management systems (RFMSs). While current agrochemical practices in the Albufera Natural Park are included by default, users can simulate and compare alternative scenarios by modifying or introducing new chemicals and management systems. This makes ERAHUMED a powerful resource for exploring future changes in agricultural practices or regulatory strategies.
