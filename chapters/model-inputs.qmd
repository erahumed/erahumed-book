# Model inputs {#sec-model-inputs}

This chapter will collect all model inputs (numeric parameters, as well as more complex information such as time-series or data-frames). The description should be generally succinct and parameters should be collected in a table - leveraging on `erahumed::erahumed_docs()` to retrieve parameters documentation).

The goal here is not to explain in detail what every parameter represents, which will be clarified when explaining the algorithms. Rather, the goal is to have a central reference for all users inputs.

The table could contain links to the sections describing the specific algorithms for which the parameters being described play a role.
