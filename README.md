# The ERAHUMED Decision Support System reference manual

This repository hosts the reference manual for the ERAHUMED DSS. The manual is 
designed as a [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) book, with a website version that 
you can access [here](https://erahumed.github.io/erahumed-book/). A PDF version 
is available [here]https://github.com/erahumed/erahumed-book/blob/master/_book/ERAHUMED-DSS.pdf).

The manual is currently WIP. Further information, including technical 
documentation for the website administration, will appear in the Wiki section 
of this repository 
(TODO [#6](https://github.com/erahumed/erahumed-book/issues/6)).
