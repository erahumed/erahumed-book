# The ERAHUMED Decision Support System reference manual

This repository hosts the reference manual for the ERAHUMED DSS. The manual is designed as a [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) book, with a website version that you can access [here](https://erahumed.github.io/erahumed-book/). A PDF version is available at TODO [#3](https://github.com/erahumed/erahumed-book/issues/3).

The manual is currently WIP. Further information, including technical documentation for the website administration, will appear in the Wiki section of this repository (TODO [#6](https://github.com/erahumed/erahumed-book/issues/6)).
