# Hydrological Balance

This chapter describes the calculation of quantities related to hydrological balance. There are two levels of modeling involved:

-   "Global" balance, *i.e.* the balance of the Albufera Lake. This step involves a reduced set of assumptions, and really boils down to the calculation of the lake's daily total inflow, from its measured outflows and precipitation/evapotranspiration levels, and from the measured water level changes.

-   "Local" balance, that is the hydrological balance of rice paddy clusters in the Albufera National Park. This step uses the output of the global balance calculations, and involves a much wider set of assumptions about how the draining and irrigation of rice paddies is managed, to approximate as closely as possible the ideal water levels required by sowing, fertilization, *etc.* during the year.

## Global balance of the Albufera Lake

This modeling layer computes the total daily inflow to the Albufera Lake, from the measured outflows and precipitation/evapotranspiration levels, together with the measured water level changes. The relevant equation expressing the hydrological balance is:

$$
\text{Inflow} + \text{Outflow} = \text{Volume Change} - \text{Rain} + \text{Evapotranspiration}
$$ {#eq-hb-global}

where the unknown is $\text{Inflow}$. The subsections that follow explain in detail how the various volume terms appearing in @eq-hb-global are actually obtained from measured quantities.

### $\text{Volume Change}$ term

The lake volume change is obtained from the measured water height change, 
assuming volume and height are related through a linear storage curve:

$$
\text{Volume} = a+b\cdot \text{Height}
$$ {#eq-linear-storage-curve}

The volume *change* that appears in @eq-hb-global is given on day 
$d$ by:

$$
\text{Volume Change} (d)=\text{Volume}(d+1)-\text{Volume}(d)
$$ {#eq-volume-change}

The default values used for $a$ and $b$ are discussed in Appendix 
@sec-storage-curve. 

### $\text{Rain and Evapotranspiration}$ terms

The volume changes due to precipitation and evapotranspiration are also assumed
to be linearly related to the corresponding measured water levels (usually 
expressed in $\text{mm}$):

$$
\begin{split}
\text{Rain}(\text{m}^3) &= \alpha \cdot \text{Rain}(\text{mm})\\
\text{Evapotranspiration}(\text{m}^3) &= \beta \cdot \text{Evapotranspiration}(\text{mm})\\
\end{split}
$$ {#eq-petp}

The default values used by the software $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are discussed in 
Appendix @sec-storage-curve.

### $\text{Outflow}$ term

The Albufera lake has two sources of outflow, namely estuaries (*golas*) and 
enclosed marshlands (*tancats*) [TODO: are these terms appropriate?], so that we
may write:
$$
\text{Outflow} = \text{Outflow}_{\text {estuaries}}+ \text{Outflow}_{\text {marshlands}}
$$ {#eq-outflows}

The outflows from estuaries are monitored by the 
*Confederación Hidrográfica del Júcar* (CHJ), which makes the measurements 
available on a daily basis (see @sec-data-hydro-balance). This results in three 
additive terms:
$$
\text{Outflow}_{\text {estuaries}} = 
\text{Outflow}_{\text {Pujol}}+
\text{Outflow}_{\text {Perellonet}}+
\text{Outflow}_{\text {Perelló}}
$$ {#eq-outflow-estuaries}
corresponding to the three estuaries of the Albufera lake: *Gola de Pujol*, 
*Gola del Perellonet* and *Gola del Perelló*.

In contrast, the outflow from marshlands is not a measured quantity, and can 
only be estimated through some additional assumption. The relevant constraint, 
with a small leap in logic, is that for each day in the considered time series, 
either  $\text{Outflow}_{\text {marshlands}}$ or $\text{Inflow}$ must be zero.
[TODO: what is the underlying assumption here?]
